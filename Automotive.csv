"I arrived at 3 PM and the dealership closed at 6 I thought I had left plenty of time to purchase a vehicle they were understaffed. The sales manager assisted me in allowing me to test drive and then had my vehicle appraised while a salesman freed up, I appreciated him taking the initiative. My financing went through in 15 minuets and I signed by 6PM. My salesman stayed and setup my car along with showing me all the options until 7:30PM never once making me feel rushed or like an imposition, I honestly appreciate the customer service they provided.",Positive
"I dropped my car off on a Wednesday morning for a diagnostic with John Salmon. I was told I would receive a call Thursday morning around 10 am. After not receiving that call, I proceeded to call several times over the next several days and after nobody responded, I went to the dealership but no one is there on Saturday. After my second trip up on Monday, one of the service advisers, Jerry, looked into the situation for me. After 10 minutes he came back and said that he doesn't know all the details, but found out that my car had been in an accident 4 days prior. I was in shock. He had no idea why I was not informed and told me the manager, Brian, would be in touch with me. The manager did call the next morning, but left a message without any details and just said to call him back. Which I did an hour later, and was told he left early for the day. He called me the next day, in the morning, and again left a message without any details. I proceeded to call him several times throughout that day without a call back. I left a message asking if he could meet at 4 pm, no response. I went to the dealership at 4 pm where I received a phone call from him at 4:05 saying he was not able to meet because he was leaving and will not be in the next day either. I told him I was there. He came to the service station and very lightly and without detail just said my car was in an accident and that they are going to fix it. All he said it was swiped against another car, needs a new bumper, headlight, and they would fix the alternator for free. I was frustrated and demanded more detail from him as he was trying to rush me out the door to get on his way. I stood my ground and demanded to know more details, asked why I have not been offered a loaner car, and need my car to be fixed so that it doesn't look like it was just in an accident. He agreed, told me the car would be in the shop for another week, and sent me on my way laughing that my car would look better after everything then it did before and blaming the reason I wasn't informed about the accident on John Salmon for being out sick. I was never offered an accident report, never saw any pictures, and when I finally received my car back it had over spray all over the engine. 2.5 weeks in the shop when it was dropped off for a diagnostic. 3 trips to the dealership and lots of phone calls just trying to find out what was going on with my car. 7 days to corner the manager and find out what happened and when I'll get my car back. 2.5 weeks in the shop. Zero respect from the manager and no accident or repair reports for my records. I will never go back there and deal with Brian, the Cadillac service manager, again. Nor will anyone I have told my story to. Extremely unprofessional and disgusting the way that place handles business. ***TL;DR: Dropped my car off for a diagnostic. They wrecked it. Didn't tell me for 6 days and ignored all my messages. I had to corner the manager, Brian, in the service station and demand to know what happened, when I'll get my car back, and a loaner car since they did not offer up either. 2.5 weeks to get my car back and had over spray all over it since they had to replace the bumper and headlights. This place is awful.***",Negative
My parents have been buying cars off of Donna Dunnivan for over a decade and have always been satisfied. I just got my first new car courtesy of Donna and I couldn't have been more pleased with the transaction! Things went very smoothly and she walked me through the set up even after Cochran has closed up the showrooms. She went above and beyond to get me my new vehicle that night and I have nothing but good things to say about the sale. I'm sure I'll be back to see her for my next one!,Positive
"I recently bought another car from Donna Dunnivan at #1 Cochran, and I can't rave enough about the wonderful service she provided me yet again! DJ, as she is fondly called, always goes the extra mile to get her customers every answer needed in purchasing a car. I had the same experience in 2005 when I bought my Saab from her. Her attention to the service of her customers truly makes her an invaluable and an incredible car sales person! I used to dread the experience of buying cars before meeting DJ. I no longer feel that way with Donna Dunnivan at #1 Cochran. I refer many to her to buy cars, and they always come back to me sharing similar experiences. I will continue to buy cars from her for a long time to come!!",Positive
"I had to schedule an appointment due to the airbag recall. I used the website, which was straight forward. I dropped off the car at 8am and I requested that my car be fixed by 1pm that day. When I called at 1pm to check the status, the car was ready. It was nice to know they were able to keep their promised.",Positive
"Leslie, Your and your team should review my correspondence with your dealership. You missed, and admittedly I didn't clearly elaborate on in my review, one of the key failures on Cochran's part. Dodging my review by misplacing blame on me being in Japan was a nice touch. That being said, my being in Japan was largely irrelevant. I made it abundantly clear, several times, from the very first time I made contact, that I COULD NOT BE REACHED BY PHONE. I believe I mentioned this at least three times in written messages, and twice by phone (I was able to dial out using Skype). Despite this, one of your salesman, Bruce Auth, tried twice to call my phone but never reached out by email until the 6th day. My request for the build sheet was not even something that could be relayed by phone. So why was he trying to call anyway? I also requested a rough trade in value for my Escalade, which I provided a ridiculously in depth description of. I never received that.",Negative
"We called to ask if they had any red Escalades because we were ready to buy that day. We didn't want to wait because our other vehicle had broken down beyond reasonable repair. They said yes so we made the 30 min trip to Monroeville. We get there and they try to show us other vehicles. After about 10 minutes, we were told they didn't have any red Escalades and that it'd have to be ordered. We walked out. Wasted an hour of driving for this crap dealership and service.",Negative
Update on my review. Scott the initial salesperson has been in contact with me and will rectify this situation! I recommend #1 Cochran for any future auto needs,Positive
"If you're planning on buying a Cadillac, See Lee Plimpton. I just signed the paperwork for my second Cadillac from Lee. I plan on always buying my vehicles from him.",Positive
Such a great experience! The staff were very nice and helped me out a lot with a reasonable price. I definitely recommend going to 1st choice transmissions! Fast and reliable!,Positive
"Absolutely wonderful service and best place to get your car fixed. The owner Al, is a truly genuinely good person. He's not a scam artist like a lot of other mechanics. Bring your car here and you will not be disappointed, I promise. I will only come here. I would recommend this business to everyone in need of repairs. The owner truly cares about his business and takes pride in it, he personally ensures that each car is properly taken care of. Outstanding service!",Positive
"Al Lake, the owner, is first rate. He has owned this place for 20 years and been in the business for 34 years. He knows transmissions. I first called the dealer and the quote I got for my Transmission service was $399, typical dealer price. Al's price was less than half. But more importantly I feel he gave it a personal touch of somebody who cared. It was the first time I've used 1st Choice Transmission and I will be sure to use him whenever I have a Transmission problem. 5 stars for sure.",Positive
This shop has been great to work with ... they went over and beyond to service my car .. after researching other places 1st choice had the best prices ... I believe the owners name is Al and he really strives to make his customers happy ... very happy .... this will be my new shop ..,Positive
"I had an emergency with my 2005 Jeep Liberty 4 wheel drive. It died on an exit ramp on the 215. I called my mechanic friend & got a referral to this place. I knew it was a transmission problem because it wouldn't get into 1st, 2nd or Drive gears. I spoke to Al & he told me to call a number to get my car towed to his garage & he would check out my Jeep. The towing company arrived a while later & we got to the garage. Al explained to me that he had to have his mechanic take apart my transmission after I explained what i had done prior to that day & what the check engine lights told him. There were about 9 different codes so we both knew that there was extensive damage. Worse case scenario would be a rebuilt transmission or there could be an easy fix. He couldn't give me a approximate cost because he needed to take apart my transmission. Al said that he would try to cut costs where he could by charging less for his hourly fee or if he could find me a used transmission that worked just as good as a rebuilt one he would see about that. But, because my car had 62k miles & was a car that Jeep no longer made I knew that wasn't going to be easy. Al also explained that his company rebuilds the transmissions in house so that would save me money too. He was also nice enough to drive me to get a rental car at Budget. A day later we talked & he gave me the bad news. It was as we feared. There was extensive damage done to my transmission. Metal had gone throughout it & it needed to be rebuilt. He called around & the only used transmission was one that had 90k miles on it. So, it was a better option to rebuild it because it would be like brand new. He also told me that when they tried to start my car, my battery had no charge. So he would check that out too & either replace or fix the problem. I put down a $500 deposit. And they started on my car with The end date being Thursday. Al called me Thursday & told me that he had a problem. Some of the parts that were needed for my car haven't arrived so it would be either Friday or Saturday at the latest for my car to be repaired. I was a bit disappointed but, It wasn't his fault, stuff happens. He kept me updated & on Saturday Him & the mechanic worked on my car all day till it was done. They usually stay open till noon but worked later to make sure I could get the car back. Again, Al offered to pick me up at the rental car place for free. He discounted the work for $500 & put in a new battery. This guy is such a stand up guy, very honest & has a positive attitude. His customer service is exemplary. I would totally recommend him as a mechanic. In a world where auto mechanic shops are such rip off operations, this place is a breath of fresh air.",Positive
Thank you Al again for the excellent service and very low price to replace my radiator. Can't say enough how trustworthy this company is for a mechanical work.,Positive
Al is a thief. Most mechanics charge a diagnostic fee so if you don't like the quote you can pay the 100 dollars and go somewhere else. Took a 500 deposit without looking at the car. Then he kept the car for 4 days when he said he would look at it that day. Then he up charged 800 more. We paid him and the clutch which was the problem was never fixed. Don't us this guy! If you need a mechanic please don't use Al.,Negative
"I was glad for 7-11, needing hydration for me and the bike it provided much needed fuel for both of us. This corner store met all my needs and went above and beyond what I expected from the local corner store. In fact it has that small space feel, such as the neighborhood store with exceptional customer service and a pleasant customer experience too! First off stopped in for gasoline for the motorcycle, since it was indicating that fuel was required. Decided to pay at the pump since so used to this. The paying at the pump went smooth and filled up with no issues. Then when done fueling the bike went inside to get some much needed fuel for the human driver. With our extreme hot temps here in Vegas the water was where I headed first. The selection of water was well stocked and there were various flavors and varieties too. I decided to go with Fiji water although it is a little more than other water it tastes so great. The air conditioning inside the store felt oh so great as well. The check out process went nice and smooth. The cashier was very busy and handled all the customers with the same great smile and service. When I reached the counter to pay the store associate made me feel welcome and as we continued the check out dance it went smooth. My service was very pleasant and cannot wait until my next visit. Then was off to enjoy my ice cold water under the awning feeling cooled off got on the bike and headed off into the sunset.",Positive
Super friendly service I was greeted by Brittany in the most Pleasant way inform me about their special for the application free Gatorade super I might have another favor to 7-Eleven near to my house,Positive
"I'm always in here and really like the service so I thought I'd give them a yelp! Super convenient ""hence the name"" and almost always an easy in and out situation. The gas pumps can get backed up during peak hours of the day. I would try to avoid that.",Positive
Manager Roxanne way cool. Thank u for address my concern with ur employee so I wouldn't have to call the 800 number not the owners Your amazing and always kind. Best,Positive
"Great service at this locations. The morning guys are cool as hell, and there is always coffee ready to go. Working at 5am sucks, so it's nice to start the day visiting this location.",Positive
"This is always my last stop before work to top of gas and get a coffee. The staff is great. There's never a long wait at the cashier's area. My only complaint is that they no longer sell egg rolls. They always have great specials on the food. You can get 3 for 3.33 on their grill items. The food is actually pretty good and even of you didn't see what you want already heated up, the staff will still make it for you. I only reduce the stars by a point because the price of certain items (such as ice cream pints) is a totally bad deal. I don't like knowing I'm paying twice the price, but sometimes it's obvious. I also question the freshness of certain items due to the price no one will buy it for. Gah, come here for coffee and smiles from staff. Pay more for convenience.",Positive
"Good gas pricing, but there are only a few pumps and none of them print receipts at the pump, which means you have to walk inside everytime. We had 2 cars at 2 different pumps and neither of them printed a receipt or even tried to. I just hate it when you have to go in and wait in line just to get a receipt...unless they had a separate line just to print receipts!",Positive
"THE MONEY WE SAVED ON GAS WAS SPENT ON SNACKS INSIDE Gas was a little bit cheaper at this station ($3.91/gallon) and it was within ten miles of the car rental facility so we stopped here for a final fill-up before returning the vehicle. Of course, the first pump we stopped at wasn't accepting credit cards at the moment. We reparked on the other side of the station and filled up. About the same price we pay at home - glad we didn't have to do much driving while we were in Vegas! Lots of snacks and goodies inside. We bought one final soda to drink before the security line in the airport. Also, I asked the ladies at the register if I could fill my water bottle with ice and they said yes. Very nice. :)",Positive
"Have found from my own experience having driven to Las Vegas that the 7-11 gas stations have had better gas prices than any other gas stations near my son's place. This is nothing fancy, a gas station attached to a 7-11, but then you get the benefit of getting a slurpee when you gas up.",Positive
These guys did an awesome job on my 2014 Ford Expedition. Had some blown struts in the rear. They had everything swapped out quickly. Someone else was supposed to do these and had rescheduled last minute. They got me in same day and also pointed out some other items that needed attention. My rotors were cracked and it wasn't pointed when a company rotated the tires. Definitely will be coming back for sure.easy to work with.,Positive
"These guys are very honest and straight forward, I completely trust them. This is the only place I'll take my vehicles. Their rates are generous and they're very professional with handling business.",Positive
Always a good price here and always reliable. I first took my 2013 Hyundai Accent here for an inspection prior to buying it. I've since brought it in for oil changes and the 60k service. All my friends and family bring their cars here and have never had a complaint or problem.,Positive
My power steering went out while I was trying to get on the freeway. I called A&E and I had my car towed there that afternoon. The owner took great care of me. He called and explained everything to me. And he got my car fixed by 5 o'clock! They provided me with great service. They are friendly and honest at A&E!,Positive
"These guys are the best. I highly recommend. They are good at what they do and if you have any special cars or projects they do them right. Than you guys Dan, Mario, Art and Jim you guys are the best in the business.",Positive
"had a sales rep while ago from this company at my house and was trying to sell me on their services. when i politely declined however the sales rep became very rude loudly stating "" have fun getting pulled over then!"" i feel that was very inappropriate and unprofessional and the guy threw his card at my door so frankly was very inappropriate as a customer i feel i would rather spend money at a more considerate company",Negative
"Always honest, prompt and fair in my dealing with them. Never a misdiagnosis and always well explained. If you're looking for a one stop mechanic shop I wouldn't hesitate to recommend A&E, especially ask for Mario as he is my go to guy!",Positive
"We really like this shop. The owners are fair and honest, helpful and efficient. It was recommended to us by friends, a real gift as we drive older cars.",Positive
These guys are truly amazing. Chance one of their ex employees ( studying to be an accountant) helped us out in a walmart parking lot with our car that wouldn't start. He Knew exactly how to get it going ( cleaned the battery terminals) and saved us a world of grief. He recommended A&E Automotive for a brake job that we needed. Mario and Jim who run the shop did an excellent job at a more than reasonable price. These are Guys you can trust with your vehicle...they are soooo honest and friendly. I highly recommend them to service your car. Paul,Positive
These guys wanted to charge me $100 to change a cabin air filter on my Toyota. It took me 45 seconds to change it out myself in their parking lot. Then they kept hounding me about buffing my headlight lenses for $37 a pop. They used to be really honest and reputable. Now they seem to want to prey on female patrons. It saddens me. Don't do business here if you're a woman. They'll gouge you.,Negative
Excellent service at a fair price. They give their customers an honest assessment and provide quality work as necessary. These guys are pros. They do not create or make up problems with your vehicle like many crooks who call themselves mechanics often do. This is the only place I take my car for service. You will not be disappointed!!,Positive
"I called this place and asked for a specific Technician that I was told might be able to work on my car. Got disconnected, and when I called back immediately after, the person I was talking to was ""busy"". I was told that they didn't know if they could work on my car and that they had to ask the owner, NOT the technician I asked about. Judging by other comments, I was talking to Liz on the phone. She was extremely rude and couldn't seem to answer the simple question of whether or not they could work on my car. I was told I""d have to wait for a call back from the owner. I said I'd wait while they asked the owner, and of course, he was in a meeting. I felt like I was on the phone with Verizon or some other major telecom company giving me the run around and avoiding helping or having to deal with me at all costs. It seemed as though my phone call was a nusance to them and that they didn't care about my business.",Negative
"Liz was extremely rude on the phone. I called to see how much it would be to get an estimate before I did any major repairs and she could not give me an answer. She then put my on hold, returned from hold and told me to take my car else where if I wasn't going to do the repairs there. I don't want to get into costly repairs, if I can't get a price for a diagnosis....then she proceeded to tell me the price of that would be $99-135....Geez, was that that hard to tell me that price??? Customer service on the front end was so rude, I can only image the ride I would have been taking on for the bill! I told her I would go elsewhere!",Negative
"I was looking for a good mechanic 8 years ago and spoke with a friend of mine at the office. She recommended Dutch at A&M Auto Service. I soon started to see why she liked Dutch so much - instead of confusing me with technical jargon, or giving me choices without any context, Dutch took his time to explain what was happening with my vehicle, what my choices were, the impacts, and his own recommendation. I soon learned that Dutch was a real rarity - a service provider I could trust. Trust is something that I do not give out randomly, so Dutch and his team had to really earn it. When he recommended NOT replacing items that were still functional because I could get more life out of them, I knew I had found the person I wanted to take care of my vehicles. His advice is financially based, as he sees my vehicles from MY perspective - as mechanical conveyance that I need to keep as along as it is cost effective. If my repair bills start to outweigh the cost of a newer vehicle, then its smarter for me to replace that vehicle. Its too bad other reviewers don't get that. My current approach with Dutch is to religiously bring my vehicles by every 5k for maintenance. I ask Dutch and his team to do whatever is needed, and to let me know if there is something unusual. I will always get an explanation of what work has been done, and any items that they are tracking or that I should watch for. Its refreshing to have a trusted person who I can bring my car and truck to - just dropping off the key with a ""please take care of my vehicle"". I don't worry that I am being upsold, cross-sold, oversold, etc. And because of that, Dutch has a customer for life",Positive
Professional and honest. Dutch runs his shop with a rare code of integrity that makes this business a real pleasure to use. I have no concern when I bring my cars here that they will only receive the repair work the car needs and it will be done right.,Positive
"Amending my previous review for two reasons: 1) Just got a call from the tow truck company, saying that they found my envelope with my estimate mixed in with the tow truck driver's paperwork. So that was not A&M's fault. HOWEVER... 2) I took my car elsewhere for a second opinion this morning and I was told that although my brake rotors & pads did in fact need replacing (as expected), my brake calipers & hoses were fine (contradicting what I was told at A&M) and I was quoted a price $300 dollars cheaper than A&M which just confirmed my suspicion that A&M was trying to use scare tactics and rip me off.",Negative
"A&M Autoservice is just past ""downtown"" Pineville; on Downs Circle(which is no longer a circle). Search it out for once you know about it you won't ever look for somewhere to take your car again. As a female who is mechanically challenged, I never knew if I was being sold unnecessary services or products. This shop is trustworthy,reliable and professional. As priceless as finding a great hairdresser! Can't recommend highly enough.",Positive
"I have been taking my car to Dutch over the past few years and can say that he is absolutely an honest and reliable mechanic. He provides thorough explanations anytime that he finds something wrong with a car and gives you a couple of options for fixing the issue. I go out of my way to bring my cars over to Dutch, and would recommend his shop to anyone who needs a decent mechanic.",Positive
"This is my very first review on Yelp and I'm doing it because of the great experience I had at A&M AutoService. This place is just great. I'm new to town and they were gracious enough to take me in without an appointment. My problems were solved immediately and everything is transparent. If you need a good auto shop, this is the place to be. Two thumbs up",Positive
"Do you like things done the Old School way? Do you look for honesty, integrity, professionalism and skill in the businesses you deal with? If you need (and who doesn't?) an automotive repair shop in the Charlotte area get to A&M Auto Service in Pineville. Mr Dutch Silverstein is the owner and I've never met anyone who knows as much about cars as he does. His crew of mechanics are highly trained and certified. Ductch was a commercial airline pilot for many years and knows what customer service should mean in the real world - not a slogan, but honest service you can rely on. If Dutch says it's fixed you can bank on it. My 1999 BMW needs TLC. No one but A&M works on it.",Positive
"A good mechanic is hard to find and Dutch is the best! I discovered him from a neighbor who is quite capable of working on his own cars. He takes his cars to Dutch when it is something too time consuming or difficult or he lacks the proper tools. Dutch has the best customer service skills I've seen in the industry. He even called me back 6 months after I had transmission work done, just to see if I was still happy with the work.",Positive
"My 2005 Chevy has just over 130k on it so when my transmission started slipping I knew what was in store. What I didn't know was it could be better than new. Wow! Nice smooth shifting, crisp quick downshift when I hit it...I am truly impressed, these guys know what they are doing. From the front staff, Justin and Stephanie who are terrific, to the job the mechanic did on my truck, to the price for the transmission rebuild, I couldn't be happier. Thank you AAMCO Transmissions and total car care for exceeding my expectations! I feel like I'm driving a new truck.",Positive
"Started getting oil changes here a couple years ago after I moved from the east valley. Since then, got my serpentine belts replaced- they charged BELOW the quote! Just got my fuel injector system cleaned, recommended by dealer when I went in for a recall notice. They did 3 part cleaning and decarbonization for $50 BELOW dealer quote just for the cleaning! Great shop, no ""hard sell"" (You better get this done now or you might break down driving home!), Staff are all wonderful, work is done in timely fashion, and Kurt will give great advice about keeping your baby rolling! Only downside- MAKE AN APPOINTMENT! They are super busy, and for good reason!",Positive
"So my story goes like this, my car broke down turns out I knew exactly what... It was...the alternator I took it to AAMCO and I was looking at it like this is gonna cost a pretty penny -previous week which has nothing to do with my car my grandmother had a stroke my car is the main transportation to see her so I was trying to figure out how I would pull a rabbit out of a hat I made my appointment spoke with this young lady super super nice her name was Stephanie she let me know that they will take good care me and call me about the diagnosis. Few hours later I heard from a young man named Justin he called me and At the time I was just so negative that I really didn't look at the bigger picture I had brought my car in to get fixed I luckily had a great mechanic and it wasn't gonna cost me a lot of money to be fixed. Justin reminded me of the most important thing -I was awake and alive and had a clean bill of health all of which were more important then my then my car. So I come in Saturday, March 24 to pick up my car Justin and Stephanie of course were very polite and took care of me I paid and expected to be done . Justin walked me to my car thinking that was that little did I know my car was in complete working condition I was contemplating bringing my car back to have them look at that electrical issues that I was having before it broke down I was having but turns out they really fixed it ! I would recommend the shop to anybody and everybody I know I will scream it if I had to but for now I'd like to say thank you AAMCO !!!",Positive
Normally when I go get my car taken care of it's never fun. At this AAMCO all the employees were cracking jokes and making it a really awesome experience! Special shoutout to Stephanie and Kurt,Positive
Charlie is very helpful and knowledgeable as are the rest of the staff. They actually care about their customers and the quality of work they perform here. After having my car diagnosed by a dealership and quoted thousands of dollars to fix I took it here for a second opinion and the problem was fixed for $80 and everything claimed by the dealer to need replaced was in perfect operating condition.,Positive
"I came in to visit the AAMCO because my car was having troubles around the corner. It was leaking and ejecting coolant onto the hood causing it to steam. Turns out it was the water pump. Had my cousin go with me who was a former mechanic and he verified that was they were saying was true. Total cost was out of my budget up front but financing was available. They told me how long it would take after that and ended up helping me out. I left to go hangout a bit before returning to find that the owner himself was out there grilling hot dogs, burgers and potatoes! He gave me a free hot dog and in the process informed me that a part of my serpentine belt assembly accidentally broke off and that they were ordering a new part for my vehicle, on them, and of course the labor would be included as well. A very wonderful establishment that I would highly recommend and will definitely be going back to next time my car has any issues.",Positive
"Kurt and his staff are kind, professional and knowledgeable. They went out of their way to help me get my 02 Trooper running safely and even better than when I first purchased it. This is the only shop I'll be going to now.",Positive
"This is the ONLY place I will take either of my cars. I have a 2008 Dodge Avenger and my boyfriend has a 2014 Hyundai Veloster. I've been coming here for over 2 years at this point, and it's the only place I trust with either car. Kurt is amazing and won't lie to you and Manny is always at the front desk with a smiling face. I've had so many issues even with the dealerships, but Kurt and the entire team are great. They will do everything in their power to make sure the job gets done right the first time. They're the only place I trust either of my cars with, and they're the only place I will ever take my cars.",Positive
"My company has had me bring two vehicles into the shop. Kurt, the man at the front, is friendly, professional, knowledgable and an all around good guy. I highly recommend utilizing this business for your automotive needs.",Positive
"Kurt and staff are amazing with their level of service and attention. I received a quote from another repair shop (on the recommendation of a colleague) and it did not look correct. Kurt diagnosed it correctly, repaired it right and also found other flaws that would have left me stranded in a very remote part of the state as I was trying to leave town on a hunting trip. They stayed very late that night making sure I was able to leave on my trip the next day and was also flexible on the payment for the repairs. One of the parts that got installed was factory defective and the next day Kurt and mechanic drove to Flagstaff to replace it at NO additional cost so I could continue on my trip. That is customer service and the reason why I will take my vehicles no where else for repairs and service!",Positive
"I went there to get my green machine rodeo looked at to see why I had engine power loss. Anyway, I have to put down a $1,200 deposit. Needless to say, they put a junk yard engine in it that wouldn't pass emissions. Corporate and the manager Kurt didn't want to do a thing about the fact I never gave consent for a new engine. I wanted to know what was wrong with mine. On top of never getting status updates about what was going on. DO NOT EVER GO HERE. YOU WILL REGRET IT",Negative
"My transmission recently went out. I was stressed out and had no clue how i would come up with money to replace it. A close friend recommended this shop to me because they finance. I was a bit relieved. Not only did they get me a great price on a replacement on my trans but they got me back on the road in a matter of two days. The service i received was amazing, The guys at the shop made me feel like i shouldn't be as worried, that everything would be fine. I was very pleased with the service and would recommend them to any family or friend that's having car trouble.",Positive
Very helpful and courteous but more importantly they provide amazing service at outstanding prices! Honesty is huge and we've always experienced that!,Positive
"Kurt and all the guys at AAMCO were amazing fixing the transmission in our 07 Suburban. After looking at our car their description was that a ""grenade had gone off in our transmission."" Ouch!! They were quick to put it back together and even when there were a couple of glitches, they were quick to resolve the problems. No one ever wants car problems, but if we have them again we will definitely go back to AAMCO!",Positive
"Had to get a check engine light looked at and this place was able to accommodate my busy schedule. Shawn was an excellent person to deal with. He helped make everything clear and earned my trust with his professional demeanor. Anyways, he said the component that was causing the check engine light would take 3 days to acquire and fix and he lived up to it. Within 3 days i got my car back with that pesky light gone and a fresh oil change which I also requested. Will be going back there to get an oil change again this friday since my 3000 miles are up.",Positive
"I took my Jeep in and was told my transmission was missing a gear. They completely fixed my Jeep within three days, they took care of my bill with a rental car. They stayed in contact with me about the work. They help me get financed to help pay for the work done. They also recommend I bring back my Jeep for checkups. I think they done well.",Positive
"No customer service. No sense of urgency. Was told by the manager of this place I was going to get a phone call back in 10 mins, that was a failure. The longest 10mins of my life. Am yet to get a call back.",Negative
"These guys were horrible! I brought my vehicle in for a brand new transmission. It took them three weeks to finish! After returning to me my vehicle it still had transmission problems, and I had to bring in my vehicle again with the new transmission. This took another week and a bunch of phone calls to get ahold of them. I was very displeased with the service as it took forever and I had to bring it in again after they put in the new transmission. The WORST part was a ONE YEAR LATER their new transmission had problems again and was COMPLETELY JUNKED. I took it to the dealership to be done the right way. It cost me thousands and it was only good for a year till it had to be replaced. WHAT A JOKE. I write this review to warn others that I got completly screwed at this AAMCO location.",Negative
"ARA Of Madison 1831 E Washington Ave, Madison, WI 53704 Auto Repair Shop PLACE DETAILS Jon Pfeiffer in the last week Jon Pfeiffer September 10 at 8:16pm · Madison, WI · My car has served me well for over 50,000 miles. It was the first and only car I looked at. Yesterday it hit 150,000 miles. I knew exactly what car I wanted before I looked at and test drove it in 2010 when I got it with the help of a PASS Plan. I want to thank a few people now for their help back then. Stephanie Drum of Employment Resources Incorporated believed in me and saw that I had a viable business, Jon Pfeiffer Photography. She put together and helped me complete my PASS Plan between 2008 and 2010. Lexy Frautschy, then a manager at Ian's On State interviewed and hired me in early 2008. I began working there on February 23th of that year. I bussed tables, washed dishes, took the trash out, cleaned bathrooms, shoveled snow and did construction there during the three years I worked there. Lance Owens of WORC helped me start my business which officially happened in April of 2008. He helped me build build Jon Pfeiffer Photography while Stephanie told me about and put together the plan. Lance Owens went along on my test drive with the owner. It was a 5-speed because I would not own a car with an automatic transmission. I never have and never will. I did well considering I had not driven a car with a real transmission since that bad day in May of 1999. Shannel Trudeau-Yancey of Progressive Community Services helped me get the help of DVR to obtain some of the equipment I needed for my business. Cliff Wolllin of Wisconsin DVR approved my self employment plan and with that, I got some of the equipment needed to start my business. While working at Ian's, Lance submitted some of my photography to the Overture Center resulting in seven of my photographs being displayed there in Gallery II in the fall of 2009. Cliff got DVR to pay for my display for which I am still thankful. In January of 2010, Shaun at ARA of Madison went for a test drive with me and said ""Nice car, Pfeif"" so I purchased it. With a great people working on it like Shaun and Casey at ARA Auto, Mike's crew at M&M Auto Body and the Paul's people at AMS, it continues to look and run like a car half it's age. I love my car.",Positive
"To clarify to all reading this, the car was NOT picked up on Friday, but on Sat @12:00. The car had much maintenance done to it as well as having recall items replaced by GM after our purchase of the vehicle last fall. My son has had this vehicle seen by 2 other mechanics since our visit at ARA and were informed the car has been maintained, the battery and starter/alternator are in good shape. Casey made our son pay a penny to look at the wheel that squeaked after the wheel bearing was replaced. Finally, my son never test drove the vehicle after they adjusted the wheel bearing. ""The mechanic even told my son the wheel bearing was not properly installed and that's why it squeked"" Casey will reply to this with more denials and that's what you'll get. Fyi folks",Negative
I took my 1992 Evinrude 25 hp 2 stroke and attached boat in because of cooling issues. Work was done completely and correctly and boat runs like a champ. Labor cost is a little steep but the work was correctly and the motor has run well ever since. Work was completed on schedule and this was before a holiday weekend.,Positive
"ARA is sort of a hidden gem of a automotive and marine repair shop that I have passed many times and wondered what exactly they do here. You see food carts parked at one end of the lot and cars of all vintages parked at odd angles in front of three bays. At one time years ago there was a small breakfast and lunch restaurant where the office is now. I needed some work done on a ten year old, 50HP two stroke Mercury outboard and a friend recommend ARA. I have had it in to the local marine dealer that specializes in Mercury and after three return visits the problem still wasn't fixed. It starts hard and idels rough. ADA has a guy that specializes in marine engines, especially older ones like mine, and so I had him take a shot at fixing it. They aren't cheap here but either was the other place that did not fix my problem. I was told right out that it might take a return visit after the initial fix to do some fine tuning and it did. Since most of the marine dealers do not do on the water repairs its up to the customers to take it on a shake down cruise to check it out after the initial repair. My carburetors needed rebuilding and the tech took it upon himself to get the right manual for this engine and correctly adjust the linkages to the three carbs to make my problems go away. I was not charged for the second visit or for the manual. It became a shop manual. There is a yard here to the left of the building with a locking gate but there are no fences surrounding it and it is open air, so if you drop something off have a cover for it and remove any valuables. This is true of the other repair shops as well but thought I would mention it. All in all if you have a boat or car that you like and want running correctly ARA would be a good place to call. Judging by my visits here you might see a big ski boat next to a BMW one day and a Corvette and a boat like mine the next. Pay up and give them a shot. They have been here a long time and and seem to keep busy by word of mouth alone. Google did not bring them up for marine repair but I believe it may in the future.",Positive
"I am very happy with the quality of brake work done on my car last month. They were down to metal-on-metal, This place is conveniently close to my work, and I was able to drop my car off in the morning and pick it up again by early afternoon. The price was steep, but I believe you get what you pay for. I'm about to have them replace my water pump, so I'm hoping the quality work continues!",Positive
This guy is a crook. When I took my vehicle to my regular mechanic he was so pissed he wanted to know who ripped me off!!,Negative
This place is horrible. They ripped me off so bad on an oil change and filter service. They left the old filter in there and just said they swapped it out. How can you trust a mechanic like this? Stay away...,Negative
"Adrenaline is the ONLY place I take my bikes to. Been bringing them here for a few years and they always take amazing care of me, and at an affordable price. Oscar serviced my baby yesterday and he went absolutely above and beyond to make sure every little part was in tip top condition for my cross country ride I'm about to take. Mentioned other upgrades I was wanting in the near future and he took the time to go thru the shop and found a Toce exhaust and installed it right then and there as well. The guys here take care of my ride as if it were their own and that's a big reason why I will continue to pass by prob 20 shops closer to where I live, and continue coming to Adrenaline for my bike needs. Thank you Oscar, and Jeremy for hooking me up with a great price for everything that was done!",Positive
Let me start off with sayen thank you for saving my weekend to jeremy the owner of adrenaline. I called at 8am today with my bike that would not start they camer right out and picked it up at my house and I figured my weekend way over before it started. Well 2 hours later he called me up and said he ended up having the part in stock and I'm all fixed and ready to go. Needed some sensor and that was all. He even tightened my chain up that I did not know was to loose. He said it was unsafe and no charge for it. Thanks again guys,Positive
"what r the odds? i needed tires for my hd xxx a while back and had them replaced locally 85201. tuesday morning between 9am-10am somone dumped a sh!$ load of used motorcycle tires in my alley right behind my new house. i am responsible bc i own that part of alley. bc i just bought the place, i put up surveillance cameras to stop the tweakers from stealing the copper and such. instead i get video of motorcycle tires being dumped?? because we ride, i do not want to take this matter to the police, it would be awesome if those tires would be removed the same way they arrived or i will publish the video showing how they got there, with a review. to be fair i will list another possible candidate but i already know who it is because one of those used tires appears to be one of mine!!! seriously? what are the odds?? wtf.",Negative
My only experience is bringing my rims off bike here to get new tires. First time i bought tires from the shop and got free m&b. Next time i bought tires online and got m&b price a little cheaper than cycle gear. Both times the work was completed in less than 24 hours. Only reason i didn't give 5 stars is I'm unaware of their other services.,Positive
"Worst experience of my life.... BEWARE AMATEUR WORK (cant even do simple oil change without screwing it up) This kind of company is why I shy away from having work done by people I do not trust. I stopped in to have an oil change a few weeks ago. I was quoted $75-85. I told them to go for it. I walked down the street to grab a bite to eat in the meantime with my girlfriend. We came back about an hour and a half later. Only to be told that there was a problem. Now I am no ""professional"" when it comes to bikes/automobiles, but I have been doing my own oil changes for as long as I have been driving. And only stopped in to a shop to have it done on occasion. On this particular occasion my girlfriend and I were planning on taking a nice ride up through Canyon Lake that weekend and I was short on time. And thus stopping in at Adrenaline Performance. Now the problem that I was told was that my oil drain plug was ""stripped out."" I asked them how that can be? Jeremy stated that it was probably like that when I brought it in. But NOW it will not hold oil but was perfectly fine when I rode my bike there. This leads me to believe that they at Adrenaline Performance had stripped out my oil pan. I ask Jeremy how much it would cost to fix it. This Scammer said $800-1000 for a ""factory"" fix. But he had a buddy that owned a machine shop that could possibly fix it for $350-400. I was taken back by these numbers. So I decided to see what this horrible human being was going to try to pull next. I walk into the shop area and crawl under my bike and test fit my once perfectly fitting secure oil plug. Yup, its stripped. Now while I was on the ground, this guy has the nerve to offer up a trade. ( I work for an HVAC company and was wearing my company uniform) Jeremy asks how about a trade to fix what they have broken on my bike. But he caught my attention so I indulge him. He tells me he needs a mini-split Air Conditioner installed and would fix my bike. He even says he ""knows"" the price for the AC is a bit more. A bit more???! Really Jeremy? Let me install a $3200 system for a quoted $350-1000 fix. I tell him I couldn't do the trade. Now he has one more offer...he says that since I couldn't afford to fix my bike, he has another friend that buys broken bikes and pays cash...HOLY CRAP Jeremy, did you just try to buy my baby that I literally just rode in here a couple hours ago after you had broke it? This guy can basically go to you-know-where!!! Now I cant ride my bike at this time since there is no oil, so he offers to tow it back to my house for $15, sadly he didnt have his truck there so that was out of the question. I tell him just let me have my bike back and you'll never hear from me again. He said he cant do that because I am in his system. He then proceeds to charge me. YES he charged me $19.50 to strip out my oil pan just so I can walk away and leave with my bike. That night was a special night where it was rainy in Arizona. And my house was probably a half mile away. My girlfriend and I pushed my 1600cc Meanie a half-mile in the rain to get my bike home. Because who knows what kind of charges would have been tacked on if I left the bike overnight. Fast forward a few weeks. I have a slow day and finally get around to fixing the bike, myself. I borrowed a friends tap-n-die kit. Got the next size up oil pan bolt. Crawled under my bike, made new threads and put my new oil pan bolt in. Total cost $12 and about 20 minutes of my day. If I had to buy my own tap kit from Harbor freight I think they run about $25 I'll just round up to a $50 fix. That being said, I would have happily paid Jeremy a reasonable rate to fix it and he would have had a customer that would have probably returned for service every few months. But sadly he is one of those greedy individuals that would rather make a bunch of money and screw someone over. That is bad business and I would only assume that anyone giving this company a decent review is either friends or family. NEVER AGAIN STAY AWAY AMATEUR WORK",Negative
It took a while to figure out why my bike was cutting out but Jeremy figured it out. This issue wouldn't come up on diagnostics so it's not easy to determine. I even caught a break on some of the labor since it was a tough problem to figure out. After my tip over sensor was fixed I got a chain service and rear brake pads replaced. They even tightened up my clutch and throttle. Bike is running as good as I've seen in the 6 years of ownership. Thanks guys! 2002 CBR F4i,Positive
"It's really hard to find a repair shop that doesn't try and charge you an exorcism fee for the unicorn jumping around in your exhaust. After dealing with a couple of those places already, Jeremy was a really helpful dude who didn't screw me and instead saved me some money. I appreciate the service Jesse and Jeremy provided me with here. I will return for all my future maintenance.",Positive
Took the wheels off my Z1000 along with some new Avon Ultra Sport tires. Dropped em off with Jeremy and two hours later came back and they were perfectly mounted and balanced. 3 months ago I also had Adrenaline replace my fork seals. Not only was the work timely and top notch it was also nearly 1/2 what other shops were charging. Next up new wheel bearings.,Positive
"Jeremy at Adrenaline runs a great shop that you can take your bike to and know you're going to be treated fair and at a great price. I've been taking mine here for over a year, and have always been impressed. I'm not sure why there's such a difference in reviews for this place. Anything I've needed, they've handled. They've even helped me with odd requests like needing to find special parts, have my bike picked up, and get help with customizations. Each time, I knew I'd be dealt with in a straight forward manner and I'd be dealing with a reasonable guy who understands money matters.",Positive
"I bought a honda scooter here, second hand. There was a slight issue with the paperwork afterwards, but Jeremy and his crew took care of it. He is a man who follows through on his word. He's been around for a while and knows the ins and outs of motorcycles. He also helped me out when I lost my key, and towed my scooter for free. Definitely will do business again, he wasn't looking to make a buck on me, just wanted to help me out.",Positive
"I almost never write reviews, but Jeremy and his crew at Adrenaline Performance totally deserve an honest review. At the recommendation of a fellow rider, I took my bike to Adrenaline for the first time about 10 years ago. Never once have I been disappointed. Jeremy has always taken care of me, all the while being extremely reasonable with his pricing. He is usually very busy (a good sign, don't you think?), so he's not always able to drop everything in a moment's notice...but when he can't, he always gives me reasonable time-frames. If you want a great and trustworthy motorcycle mechanic in the Phoenix/Mesa area, Adrenaline is the place to go. As long as they're around, it's the only place I'll take my bike.",Positive
"Took my old yzf 600r here for a tune up after letting it sit for about a year. Quick turn around time of a week and it was less than that of ridenow. Carb clean/synch, oil change and coolant flush/battery was all that I had done with the difference of $300 vs $800 from ridenow. Well worth it IMO as I'm to busy to do my own work anymore. Bike rode great after the service and never had a problem up until I sold it(6 months ago). I didn't have any issues like other reviews but honestly - if you have a Duc - they are not simple creatures and that would be something you take to a mechanic SPECIFIC to Ducs- not only for their experience but also for the price. I'd caution taking your Lambo to a Chevy dealer ;) If you have a regular bike issue/tune up I definitely recommend Adrenaline.",Positive
"Being new to town I was referred to this shop by a police officer friend of mine. I just recently purchased a used 2004 Honda Shadow Aero 750VT and though it passed my initial exterior inspection I thought it would be prudent to take it in somewhere to have an expert look it over and at the very least change the oil. Great vibe as I came in and met two customers shooting the shit outside while Jeremy handled another customer. On staff that day were Jeremy, Dale and Michael (and Riley the friendly mutt!) whom where all very personable and willing to walk me through the oil change and safety inspection process. I learned a lot about my bike and can say for sure that I will come back to this honest shop whenever I need work done.",Positive
"This has to be the worst Motorcycle shop I have been to... I took my Bike here for an oil leak and after 2 moth of repairs and dealing with their unprofessional MECHANIC and OWNER Jeremy, I picked up my bike and still had the same problem as i did when i took it in. The mechanic had the nerve to talk to me like i was an idiot! and the worse part is the owner Jeremy stood their and laughed. I would not recommend taking you bike to Adrenaline motorsports!!!!!! I made several calls to the shop and all you heard in the background was the owner Jeremy and the unprofessional mechanic yelling and cussing at each other. DO NOT TAKE YOUR BIKE HERE FOR SERVICE! LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE.. I AM WARNING YOU THIS SHOP IS NOT WORTH THE EXTREME HEADACHE!!! GO ELSEWHERE!!! WARNING, WARNING, WARNING, WARNING!!!!!!",Negative
"Adrenaline Performance is outstanding! The staff's customer service is unparalleled to that of any shop I have ever been to. Jeremy and Chuck went above and beyond to help me get the right bike for me. They spent hours of their time getting the bike running and educating me about how my new bike works. They really do care about their customers here. I'm extremely satisfied with my experience at adrenaline, they definitely have a customer for life.",Positive
"I found Adrenaline on Google, and after calling and talking to the owner, decided to check them out here on Yelp. My master link broke on a Monday night, and I have work all day, then class on Tuesday night so I had no time to fix it myself. Jeremy (owner of Adrenaline) was the only place near me that could get my bike back up n running in the 9 hr time frame I had. He told me as soon as I came in to fill out the paperwork, they'd go get the bike. He wasn't kidding! No sooner had I signed the Work Order, did he and an employee get ready to go pick my bike up. Jeremys tech got my chain repaired, replaced some bolts stripped by the previous owner, and had me back up n running in time to get to my class and turn in my paper :) It's been a few weeks since they did the work, and I've had no issues so far. A co-worker who used to ride told me that Adrenaline was a bad shop and they had ripped people off, but I was happy and there's several good reviews here so I'll chalk that up to a disgruntled customer and an Internet soap box. What I really liked about Adrenaline was that Jeremy and his tech took some time to tell me about some issues they noticed with my bike, but there was no pressure to empty my bank account and have them fix everything that day.",Positive
"Absolutely love this shop. They take care of me every single time I go in there. They will match ANY price I can find, even if it is online. They are fast, friendly, informative and it just ""feels"" right in the shop. It is a bunch of motorcycle riders who love what they do and do it well. They will have my business as long as I ride in Arizona.",Positive
"I have been going to this place for yeeeeears! They are practically the only ones who have serviced this car (with the exception of a move to another part of town). I have NEVER been disappointed and NEVER treated like anything but a valued customer, and NEVER have doubted a car repair or suggestion!!! I trust them explicitly and boy, does that feel good! I am on the road in a 2005 car SAFELY and all due to the care they have given me. I don't go anywhere else!",Positive
"These guys are awesome! Extremely helpful, honest and always willing to help. And, they'll recommend what you need even if they can't help. They offer shuttle service too! Super good guys",Positive
"Very good place, right near my house. Even though they couldn't fix what I needed fixed, they sent me too an awesome body shop.",Positive
Excellent customer service and my car is always finished at a timely manner. There' re also deals for oil change and other auto services for loyal customers. I will be back when my car needs any services.,Positive
"After having a memorably bad experience with the same company in Chandler (see my review) I met Bob at their store in Gilbert. Bob is a good man who knows how to place the best interests of clients ahead of his own interests and the interests to fix things that don't need fixing. It's hard to find guys like Bob. He is from the older generation when we treated others with respect and the way we want to be treated ourselves. Guys like Bob just do what's right and in the process build GOODWILL. In an age where everyone wants to put their hand on your wallet, Bob is a rare find. I will be back and I suggest anyone who wants excellent service and honest answers do the same. Thank you Bob. You're a good man. We need more like you.",Positive
I had some work done today at this location . I received outstanding service and very fair pricing. Mike and Bob made the experience very pleasant. Seeing how I needed to wait until the work was complete they made sure I was comfortable. The business is very clean and close to restaurants. There are several automotive repair centers between my house and here but this will be my go to. Thanks guys and I'll see you soon....,Positive
"I came in here last week to get my oil changed and the service was second to none. The assistant manager, whose name escapes me at the moment, was very kind and very customer friendly (as was his crew!). I will definitely return for my next oil change.",Positive
"I pulled into this Goodyear auto center today with my radiator leaking. It was 108 degrees, I had my kids in the car and I didn't know what to do. I walked in and let them know what happened, Frank, the technician, immediately stopped what he was doing and started to fix my car. He was so friendly and quickly worked to repair the problem, filled my radiator fluid, and then they simply told me to have a nice day! You may think this is no way to run a business, but I beg to differ. They now have a customer for life.",Positive
"These guys are great! I've been taking all my vehicles here for years. Numerous times I've gone in there expecting the worse, only to find out the repair was not as bad as I had feared. Monti, Bob, Cory, Frank and everyone else at the shop are guys you can trust. They won't try to sell you repairs you don't need and even better will refer you to a different shop if it's outside their scope which is soooooo much better than trying to charge you for a fix that doesn't work. In the rare case issues arise with the repair they always stand by their warranty and make things right no questions asked. Highly recommend!",Positive
"Horrible service and over priced! Their so quick to rush you into financing the repairs. Rude, pushy, and way over priced! You have been warned, don't do it!!!",Negative
I've been going to advanced auto for several years now and they always give it to me straight and at the best price (I used to call around for quotes but now I don't even waste my time). I feel like they treat me just as they would their sister or daughter - not like an easy target. Definitely recommended. Bob & the team have been really great!,Positive
"It was time for me to replace the struts and shocks for my Mazda. Did my homework and got some estimates and figured I had to take a bite of the bullet being shot my way. As I wandered around looking for more esimates, I went to Advanced as a last resort. And I'm glad I did! They were at least $300 less than the other places I went and they were also going to put the OEM struts and shocks in. Even the dealer couldn't match that. My car rides nice and smooth now and I can tackle the rough CA highways when I go back for visits.",Positive
"Thanks to Advanced Mobile Entertainment, I was able to install a headunit that supported android auto into my Mazda and I couldn't be more happier. Paul promptly responded to my emails and any questions I had regarding to the headunit well after AME was officially ""closed"". What stands out for me between AME and the other audio shops is simply the customer service. Firstly all the other audio shops asked me to come down with my car to simply get a quote for the installation. AME not only provided me with a quote with a couple a emails but was able to answer all my questions, give a good price for the installation and was also able to book me in right away. After a couple days, I was having some connectivity issues with my headunit, and called Paul back. I had assumed that Paul had made a mistake whilst installing the headunit however we soon found out that the pioneer headunit had a history of connectivity issues with Android Phones with a type C connector. Paul went out of his way to make sure that the issue was resolved. He contacted me several days later to confirm that no issues were arising with the headunit. If you are looking to get a headunit installed especially with android auto or apple car play, I highly recommend visiting Advanced Mobile Entertainment. I'm already looking to get my father's car installed with a headunit and I know exactly where I will be going.",Positive
"Thank you Paul for your prompt response, I wanted the factory radio put back in my car. It was a smooth transition and within my budget. Customer service is excellent and important to me. Thank you Heather Cotrim.",Positive
"I am stunned. I emailed Paul for a quote for troubleshooting on my stereo and got a call within a few minutes, even though his shop is closed on Sunday. I have been having issues with my stereo for quite some time and it was causing so much frustration, but it only took Paul a few minutes to diagnose my issue and guide me through fixing it within minutes. He is very knowledgeable and communicates clearly in layman's terms. I would definitely recommend AME to anybody looking for audio installations and parts. After driving without a stereo for a few weeks, it feels amazing to finally have it working again! Thank you Paul!",Positive
"I emailed Paul for a quote on a stereo for my car, I got a reply right away. He was very helpful in helping me decide what would best suit my needs. I really appreciated his honesty when he told me that a more expensive unit I was interested in would not be right for me. I met Paul a couple of days later and had him install a nice Kenwood unit in my car. He was super friendly and very knowledgeable. Paul did a very clean and professional install and to top it off, my car was ready in an hour! I am very happy with my new stereo, and even happier that I got great customer service and a great price. Thank you Paul! I highly recommend Advanced Mobile Entertainment for your car video/audio needs.",Positive
This place is by far the best stereo shop I have been to. Everything was explained to me thoroughly. Great job Paul! You are remarkable!,Positive
"I cannot say enough positive things about Paul and Advanced Mobile Entertainment!! Firstly let me comment on the response time to my Yelp message. Paul responded to me within a very short window even though I messaged outside of regular business hours. He answered all of my questions over messaging and followed up with a phone call the next morning. I wanted a remote starter for my car and was torn between basic functions and all the bells and whistles. Paul had me go through some basic tests with my car before I even came in, to make sure that what he had would work with my car and where it's parked. I really respect someone that will give you information that will potentially loose them business because it's the right thing to do. Paul worked with me to come up with a solution that blended what I wanted with what I needed and came within my budget. He was able to get me in for installation very quickly and I'm a happy camper. Bring on winter! I would highly recommend AME for both a high level of service and professionalism without hesitation.",Positive
"AME is the best audio shop in Brampton hands down. I had so many issues with my car sound system. Front components not working. A dead kenwood head unit. I had no sound in my car for two long and painful weeks. Paul, the owner of AME, answered every single question I had. And he did so within minutes. I couldnt believe his level of customer service. I came in and he installed a new HU and repaired all of my audio issues. And the best part, he did it for such an amazing price and with a smile! I am so use to being ripped off by these audio shops but Paul is an honest man. I cannot praise him enough. Give Paul a call or message him here on yelp. He will reply FAST! 5 stars all the way. I will come back Paul and all of my friends will hear about you! ***** 5 STARS *****",Positive
I had a Pioneer head unit installed. The setup was complicated but he had no trouble installing it. I accidentally erased the setup and had to go back because the unit is not new user friendly. He spent 45 minutes more getting it right. Now it works great. Thank you very much. Roger,Positive
"My friend had some audio installed. Staff were very knowledgeable, friendly and honest. I would recommend my friends to buy stereos from here. The only thing is they forgot to vacuum up the debris left behind after they did some cutting. If they could remember to do that it would have been perfect.:)",Positive
Honesty to its finest - did my Morni's audio here (My cars name) and honesty couldn't have trusted anyone better- amazing work,Positive
"Well, they are closed as of 10-23-2017. No email even though I was working with them for a while. I am not mad it just that it was shocking that they closed their doors without any news. RIP Airport Nissan",Negative
"I took my 2012 Nissan Altima to Airport Nissan on September 29th and October 6th, 2017. On the first visit I was getting an oil and filter change. I told the service director, John Kustron that I heard a rattling noise when accelerating. He had a service technician install a couple new clamps around the loose exhaust shield. This didn't totally alleviate the noise. When I returned to the dealership yesterday afternoon it was discovered I needed a new catalytic converter. John said this would be covered under the federal emissions 8-year 80,000 mile warranty. Thank goodness. The cost for the parts and labor would be around $1,100 otherwise. John is very personable. He put some gas in my car for my (2) long trips from Euclid. The customer lounge is great. They have cold soft drinks,fresh coffee, popcorn and various other snacks. I would rather travel the extra distance to Airport Nissan instead of going to Mentor Nissan, Ganley Nissan or Bedford Nissan.",Positive
"This dealership was professional, knowledgeable and willing to work with me to make a fair deal. I received great follow up from my salesman, Rob and am happy with the overall process. Thanks for making the car buying experience a little less stressful.",Positive
"In the years I've used yelp, this is only the second review I've ever written. And I feel like I need to write this review because my experience went so dang well. So here we go: I'm a 33 year old lady who has had the good fortune to have supportive people around me who will help me negotiate things. But I'm a grown up! I need to fend for myself! And that's how I found myself walking into a car dealership alone, terrified of the impending interaction. Would they take me seriously? Would they try to screw me over? Would they tell me I should come back with a boyfriend or father figure? (All three of these things happened to me the last time I financed a car, a decade ago.) But it was pleasant from the start! The girl at the front desk was so friendly and we chatted for a few moments while we waited on the salesman to arrive. And he was great, too! His name is Scott and I highly recommend him. He was friendly and professional, and still was able to joke around with me. I told him what I was looking for, and we walked around the lot to see options. He even showed me a few cars that were cheaper but in great condition to keep my costs down. He was great about only sticking to cars in my price range. I test drove a couple and decided on one. Next came the nerve-wracking part: financing. My credit isn't trashed, but it could be a lot better than it is. I put my game face on and got ready for the humiliation, but it never came. Jeff was the finance guy, and he couldn't have been friendlier. He even got me a kielbasa sandwich when I mentioned I'd seen him eating one earlier and it looked delicious (in hindsight creepy on my part, but he took it in stride). I told him what I was willing to pay monthly, not even sure if it would pan out due to credit, but he managed to get me slightly under what I was expecting to pay. I was treated with a ton of respect and it really, really meant everything to me. Walking into a dealership, I'm sure a lot of people, especially women, feel they need to instantly go on defense, with me being no exception. I had my guard up but was so happy that it was a total breeze, and actually an enjoyable experience! I kept waiting for the Bad Moment, the moment that would leave highly-emotional me crying and running for the door, but it never came. To sum it up, I LOVED my experience, and I love my car! Definitely give this place a chance, especially if you're working with Scott, Jeff, or Akira!",Positive
"HORRIBLE! Stay away from this dealership! I live in California and never in my life have I experienced this type of customer service. Got approved for a loan on a 60k car which was for the GTR, ok great. Come to find out the car was in a pending sale. If I knew it was in a pending sale I would've never ran my credit. 3 days later no phone call or email very poor communication. I don't see the problem here I got approved for the loan I'm downing 10k I honestly don't get it you have a serious buyer that's from California that didn't even look at the car and is still Willing to buy it and ship it at my expense, but I guess the sale associate I believe her Name was akira still wanted to go fishing. imo if I was a sale associate If your trying to sell A car sell it don't beat around the bush. This would never happen in California I promise you that. And if I could give them zero stars I would.",Negative
Robert at Airport Nissan was awesome! I told him exactly what I wanted and exactly what I wanted to pay a month and he provided me with exactly what I wanted! They treated me with respect and answered all of my questions clearly and thoroughly. I will definitely go back for my next car!,Positive
"I've never written a review for anything other than restaurants on Yelp, but felt compelled to do so after buying a Nissan Sentra from Airport Nissan. My daughter just started a new job at the Ohio State Med Center and was walking to the hospital from her student housing. Some parts of the walk can be a bit sketchy and the Mrs. became very concerned about her safety. Buying a car was an easy decision, but which one became the challenge. Typically, we buy Hondas. But my experience at Sunnyside Honda has been poor to say the least, so we gave Airport Nissan a try. Matt Paradis greeted me when we walked in the door and patiently listened to what we needed. The exact model and color were at an off-site storage lot, so while we were waiting, he let us test drive a car off the showroom floor. By the time we got back from our drive, the two colors we were interested were in the lot and we sat down to make the deal. He did the usual 'Fargo' check with his sales manager and came back with a price that seemed a bit higher than my Internet research indicated. We came to a middle ground and shook on the deal. While waiting for the finance guy to write up the paperwork, Mr. Bernie Moreno, the owner of the dealership and Collection Auto Group, came by to say hello (mind you, this was a Saturday morning). Bernie seems like a great guy and you can see why his people want to work for him. The most dreaded part of the sales process for me is the finance guy...trying to push you into extended warranties, road service and rust proofing. However, Butch did a great job. He knew I wanted to get on my way, but I got intrigued with his story...former police officer, left the force so his young son would always have a daddy to come home to, worked for a competitor for a couple of years, where the owner treats his employees like they are used car buyers, and found a guy in Mr. Moreno he could trust. More importantly, he didn't try to push any other deal on me. The price I was told by Matt Paradise was the price on the contract. Within 15 minutes I was out of his office and my daughter was driving home in her new car. Not sure I've ever seen her happier! I would highly recommend Airport Nissan to anyone needing a new car.",Positive
"First time coming here, needed a tire change that I've been holding off for a while. These guys got me in and out! Literally took 20 minutes and I was on my way! I recommend Aldana Tire!",Positive
"I wish I could give less stars. We went here to mount and balance four tires and rims. We asked them to also demount the new ones because, when we bought them, there was water in one of them. $95 later, we leave. When we get on the highway, my car starts violently shaking at anything above 60mph so we have to go to another shop to figure out what happened. Only one tire was balanced in the end and there was probably 2 gallons of water still in the tire we asked them to empty. Victor was cool, but scammed us out of $95. Stuff like this gives Llantera shops a bad name",Negative
"Wow, this place is a SCAM! Called for a quote on a NEW trailer tire, went down to purchase a NEW trailer tire and what was sold to me was 13yr old used tire. I realized this when I got home to take the tire out of my car. When I called back to confront them about it, they wanted to charge me again, ultimately costing me twice the price! Completly unwilling to resolve the situation and terrible customer service.",Negative
"I've always come to this place for tires and tire services and they have always been very helpful, reliable, fast and inexpensive/affordable. Great local tire shop! Come and visit and they'll get the job done and you'll be satisfied!!!",Positive
"I'm so happy to have found this tire store!! I went to Discount Tire on Rancho to have a simple plug put into my tire. Just like last time, they insisted it wasn't fixable and tried to sell me a new tire! I'm so sick of the scam. Aldana got me in and out in 15 mins. Patched the tire, rather than plug it, and explained to me why the patch is a more reliable fix. I highly recommend them! I'll be back....hopefully not too soon though :)",Positive
"I've since stopped going to this place after 8 years. Went a month back for an oil change. Explained my car was leaking oil and to check the undercarriage as well as replace new oil. Got a bill for $10 more than I normally pay for my oil change so I chalked it up to something else they may have added. A few days later my car was leaking even worse than I brought it in for so I took it back. They checked the ""oil"" and confirmed all was well. Hubby asked them to check the sealant and gasket. An hour later they came back and said oh yeah it's the gasket. It's cracked in 3 different parts. Was also advised my transmission needed flushing. Was quoted $700 so we went for a second opinion. Yes the 3 gasket was cracked in 3 places but NO there was nothing wrong with my transmission. The same transmission they said was slipping and needed to be replaced. Not to mention my quote from another place was 60% cheaper. I was appalled that they would even quote me for another oil change since they changed the first one without checking for oil leak in the first place.",Negative
I came to Aldana tires because I was experiencing a wabbling. These guys were really helpful and polite. They checked my tires and found a mis happen rear tire. They balanced my front tires. Because I had an emergency they sold me a set of nice used tires for 40 dollars each with installation. They were quick and courteous. Because they were so helpful I decided to get the ac service as well. Thanks Aldanas. Would come here again for sure.,Positive
"Ive had nothing but great service from this shop. I've had tire repair/changes and oil service performed on 3 different vehicles, 2012 Nissan, 1998 Pathfinder, 1991 Toyota p/u. They are always quick to fit me in and get the job done. They are a full service shop but luckily I have not had to use that part of the service. The front desk is usually run by a couple of younger ladies and are always nice and will ask mechanics for answers to questions. Although it is not an Open Bay to observe you can certainly stand outside the garage bay and view your vehicle being worked on. They open M-Sat 7am to 5:30pm. They also speak Spanish.",Positive
When u go to an auto shop u expect great customer service and u pay for their knowledge. What u get is less than satisfactory. And sometimes you don't understand why? For example I came to this tire shop to get new rims. I got the rims. I also had them unmount and mount my tires from the previous rims. Aldana neglected to balance the tires after the install. My car had a funny shake to it so I took it to a place near my house and they told me to take the job back to Aldana. Aldana told me that he balanced the tires the first time. Then he told me that I needed to pay for balancing. Balancing is a different service from mounting service. Then he told me that I needed new tires. Aldana is not a respectable service provider for the community. Please save your time and money and go somewhere reliable.,Negative
These people rock! Was quoted a ridiculously low price on tires and was in and out in a flash. I'm all about supporting mom & pop businesses...kudos on great customer service from Victor and Emma!,Positive
"Had to get my tire patched, and I was nervous, but didn't want to drive across town on a tire that was going flat. I pulled up and was greeted by Albert, he was polite and very helpful. He took my keys and took my car to a bay. He patched my tire, put air in all my tires and charged me 10$ I was happy, my tire has stayed full of air for a few days now, I'd recommend them to anyone!",Positive
Stopped here at 10:30 this morning to Christmas shop. The place is obviously closed. There's a letter posted on the door from the lease company. They were past due in their payment.,Negative
"I was looking for some oddball parts to rebuild an old Indonesian Becak (bike rickshaw) that my family has owned for 35+ years. The guys at AMRS not only found what I needed, but had the parts in three days and for better than any price I could find. A+ for Gary his crew.",Positive
"Great customer service, honest and fair pricing. They took my so-so bike and tuned it up, replaced a few parts and its better than new!",Positive
"Just witnessed great customer service from the lady at the shop... Working prolifically with a Spanish lady, language barrier and all... She made them feel welcome and helped them despite the barrier! Very impressed!!!",Positive
"If you are ever in the market for a custom bike or board, AMRS is definitely the place to go. Went in looking for a bike for my dad and was overwhelmed by their custom and premade options. The owner Gary really helped me out because I was totally lost and didn't know what I was looking for. He knew what he was talking about and helped me pick out the perfect bike for the best price. Love small businesses like this that value their customers!",Positive
My husband looked around for a new mountain bike and we went to several stores but nothing looked as good as the Kona Bikes we've seen. I ended up surprising him with a mountain bike for his birthday and I was recommended a pretty good Kona bike to buy for him. It was more then I wanted to spend but it was worth every penny. My husband spoke non stop on the bike he got. He said it was the best bike he ever rode on. It was way better then his old one and that one was pretty pricey also. He kept saying it handled so great on the mountain trails and effortless on the climbs. Just recently he somehow bent the front wheel when he hit a rock and had to bring in the bike to get it fixed. The owner didn't even charge him for it. They are super great with their customers and the bikes are totally awesome. Thanks again guys! Hope you enjoyed your donuts!,Positive
"The morning of my birthday we went to have some breakfast, before heading out to Tempe to go buy a Diamondback from a big box retail sports store. I ran into a cousin who said he had seen some great bikes around the corner from our house by Safeway. I had totally forgotten about this place, and wasn't sure if I should buy from a small shop based on price. Man was I wrong !!! from the minute we walked in the staff were extremely helpful and knew what they were talking about. They had a good assortment of bikes including Kona on display. I'm not a bike guy so I called a cousin who rides competitively and he advised me that Kona is one of the best. In fact that's the bike he wants to get. The staff showed me several bikes from Kona including ones on line. I bought a Lava dome which by the way was a couple of hundred dollars more than what I was going to pay for the Diamondback. They ordered it and within days it arrived. Gary and Kyle got it put together and set it up for my specs. The bike is AMAZING !!! and its EXACTLY what the staff told me. I would gladly pay 2 or 3 times more for this bike just for the great customer service I received from Gary, Kyle and the staff. They are also going to be taking us on some rides soon. As a small business owner myself it is refreshing to meet others who show passion for there work. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SHOP and ITS STAFF to EVERYONE. Best bike shop in the state !!!",Positive
"This is the place to go for mountain bike, BMX, cruiser or just about anything that run on wheel. I brought a folding bike in, ask them to have it convert into a single speed. Gary and company got it done in minute, I was riding it with the hour.",Positive
"Just needed a little tweek for my bike and my son's. Tightening up seat and handlebars, air up the tires, replace reflector. You know .. little things. Took my bikes here bc it's the closest place. Here's everything they did right. Greeted me quickly and politely, helped me unload the bikes, did all my requested tasks in a timely manner (15 minutes!), loaded the bikes back in the truck, and best of all .. didn't charge me a dime! Now .. here's what they did wrong. ... *crickets* See what I did there? Seriously. I could not have asked for a better experience. I will definitely use them again .. and refer my biking friends over there. They had some beautiful bikes. Both expensive and not expensive.",Positive
Best bike shop in Arizona! They restored a old bike for me and its absolutely wonderful. My schwinn is brand new!! I just recently got a brand new electra and its a great blue color!! The service is top notch... They went through gave me ideas help with my I cant decide issues. Thank you small local business!!,Positive
"If you are ever in need of a unique bike, board or clothing this is the place to go! The staff members are very helpful and patient. No other place on the West side compares to this shop. I will be making many more visits to this shop!",Positive
"These guys are always super helpful to me, and do a great job repairing the tires on my bike even though it's not a dirt bike - it's just a cruiser. This weekend I came in with three tires that needed repair and not only did they fix the tires, but the owner saved me money - he originally said the bike might need a tire liner, then came and found us in the coffee store next door where we were hanging out while he fixed the tires to tell us that we didn't need the liner after all. He could easily have sold us something we didn't need, but he was honest. We are happy to support this local business.",Positive
Not sure what that chick is talking about...been buying bikes here for years and love it. The owner is very helpful and they always have the best gear from their vendors.....shops like this blow away craphole big chains that claim to be board/ride shops,Positive
"WORST customer service EVER. Extremely rude and VERY unorganized! Will NEVER return! It amazes me how a small business like this would treat customers as they did me and my sister, maybe it was becuase we were women. They told us a different story everyday, about an item we ordered. We finally received it 4 weeks later! When we were told the day we ordered it it would be in the next day!!!! Plus you walk in to the place and there is just stuff EVERYWHERE just clutter and not very appealing at all.",Negative
They fixed a one and a half chair I had. It looks brand new ... they did an amazing job. I would definitely recommend this company for any upholstery issues you may have.,Positive
This Family owned business is a class act all the way! I gave Armentas upholstery a call and they came to my house to pick up the pieces a few days later. They handled the pieces with incredible care. I was super happy with the quality of their work and the friendliness. I will definitely be recommending them to everyone I know!,Positive
"I stopped by to have my JetSki seat re-upholstered. Armando and his son did excellent, quick, and reasonably priced work. That experience led me to think they might just be able to do more. And they could! Much more. The leather armrest in my truck was next. Excellent satisfaction. Then they did another leather armrest in a car. Same result. I saw antique furniture in the shop that was being done to look new. I will not hesitate to go in again. Thanks guys!",Positive
I brought 6 chair cushions in from an antique dining room set. They were absolutely perfect. Such incredible workmanship. I highly recommend this craftsmen.,Positive
5 star quality upholstery! Extremely happy with how my couch turned out. Couldn't of asked for a better experience with this family owned business.,Positive
Joseph was AMAZING with my car. This was the first time I had it detailed and it actually shines. There was this funky smell in it that he eliminated and the car looks better than it did when I got it. I'm definitely bringing my family's cars to him when I can! Highly recommend.,Positive
"Very good service overall. Went there because of the reviews here and wasn't disappointed, great people. I bought my car and was in need of serious interior deep clean up. They did an excellent job, it was spotless. I didn't have anyone to drove me back and forth to my job, and they were so kind to take me and pick me up afterwards.",Positive
I drove from California to St. Joseph and my car was filthy. Joseph and staff were very friendly and professional. They did an excellent job and made the extra effort to ensure the car was perfectly clean. I highly recommend them.,Positive
"They have the best service ever! Joseph was really helpful and easygoing. I had a really annoying situation, it was complicated and the result was that my back seats were all soaked up by food oil... I was worried and upset until Joseph cleaned my car. It looks and even smells super clean, just like a brand new car. He also offered complimentary car wash service without me even asking for it! I went to this place because I read the reviews on google, so hope my review help you guys make up your mind as well!",Positive
Not really know why there is somebody gave a one star and after read it I am still going to give a full star. I checked my car after reading that comment and found nothing but cleanness. The stuff there have the best smile and attitude you could ever seen. Also their works are great which make my car looks like a brand new one. The offers ride to take you to your places and take you back after the car is done. They even gives me a welcoming waxing for free... I would say that this place is the best around here with a pretty reasonable price.,Positive
"Joseph was outgoing and has a great sales personality. Honesty is his policy and he aims to please. He even cut me a deal Bc he saw me walking by a few times while my car was in the shop. He complimented me and said I looked 10 years younger than I am. He made me feel like I was in good hands. I liked his personality and read good reviews so I decided to give him a chance- You know, since I was getting a ""deal"". This place should be called- you better PAY ATTENTION to the details. I got a *good deal* because we are *friends* Actually - I just got bamboozled out of 120 plus 18$ tip. I should have looked harder- I didn't think I would have to look under the seats, I just paid for a Detail - right ? Also, I don't really believe the car was even hand waxed. It rained two days after and the water didn't bead up at all. There were streaks on the INSIDE of my windshield that weren't there before - actually streaks of everything. If this review is hard to read it's Bc my head is still spinning. And the more I think of it- the more upset I feel. What a disgrace. If you want more details, contact me- I'll give you the full run down.",Negative
"This car service place specializes in premier car washes and amazing customer service. Joseph and the staff were SO nice when I took my car to get washed. I took my car half an hour before the shop was closing. Regardless, Joseph and his staff kindly agreed to wash my car right when I brought it in. I was really impressed at how quick Joseph and his team were able to wash my car, vacuum the car and detail the car. They definitely did not sacrifice any quality in the cleaning during the time it took them to wash my car. My car looked brand new! Joseph also allowed me to inspect the car to make sure it was to my satisfaction. He wouldn't let me drive off the lot until my car was just perfect! It was so nice of Joseph and his team to do this for me. This was the most professional and pleasant experience I've ever had. He also noticed my car was scratched and said he would be happy to buff it next time I come. I will definitely be coming back. This is my new go-to place to get my car cleaned!",Positive
Amazing job. Had my first car wash here after driving all the way from PA. They did what I expected and even more. I will definitely come back again. Highly recommended!,Positive
"When I was searching for a place in the Urbana-Champaign area to get my car's interior detailed, this place had the best reviews. I took a chance and called to set an appointment. Joe explained everything over the phone and we set up a time that was suitable for me. His prices that he quoted were very reasonable. I dropped the car off and it took about 5-6 hours for the detailing to finish. Wow, was I impressed when I came back to pick up my car. The interior looked as good as when I bought the car. He even waxed the outside of the car for me. Driving the car away, I had the same feeling I had when I drove it off the lot. It has rained the past 4 days, but my car still has its shine. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area and I plan on going back sometime in the future.",Positive
Joe was awesome and did the best job detailing my vehicle exteriors. He knows how to handle cars and takes good care of them.,Positive
This place was awesome. Dog hair was all over in car - I was unable to get it out. and the car looks brand new. They also washed and waxed for free. I recommend this place to everyone. Car looks new!,Positive
"I found Attention to Detail on Yelp, read all of the reviews and was convinced to try it. Joe and his staff did an excellent job. I am a car guy and very particular when it comes to my cars. They exceeded my expectation and I've never had an engine detail as good as this one. I will return with my other cars---they were that good. So, Joe, keep up the good work and others like me will spread the news for you. Thank you.",Positive
"I am really excited to share with you my excellent (10/10!) experience here. My car was seriously ratchet and busted when I brought her in but, after some work my baby girl is so sleeky clean . I can tell they really care about the quality of their services and the satisfaction of their customers-- SO, if you're in the UIUC area and your car needs some pampering, I wouldn't think twice about hitting Joseph up! If you're a student don't be shy to ask for his student discount! (He offers rides too, if you need to be back on campus.) (: ALSO, when winter comes I believe he's the only one in town to do undercarriage washing (so that's something you might want to consider)!!! I promise I only really give shout out(s) to places that exceed my expectations, so thank you for reading this far and I hope you'll have a great experience with Joseph too! (:",Positive
I wanted to get my car cleaned up as it has never but detailed before. I looked around on yelp and this place had good reviews so thought I would check it out. Very very happy with the service and results! I had grime that had become part of one of my rims and just assumed it would never come out. 99% of it gone. Flexible schedule and offered to shuttle me back and forth. Highly recommended and will be going back!,Positive
"Answered the call after hours Friday at 8. Needed a rush job, had to take boss to dinner next week. Joseph and crew worked me in on Sunday! AND the job was very well done, even some scratches were buffed out (bonus). Definitely recommend.",Positive
"Wow! Just wow! Took our 2001 CRV in for engine cleaning, upholstery and overall car spa treatment. While there was over a week wait for an appointment (now I understand why, these guys really do pay attention to detail), the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The car was in dire need of tender loving care having been parked outside and driven in Chicago for the last three years. When I went to pick it up this evening, it had dropped 10 years. Carpets, tire rims, upholstery like new. Engine grease/dirt gone! Price was very reasonable for the amount of work done. Very impressive transformation, these guys really know what they are doing.",Positive
"Came here for my new car's first wash. I originally inquired about the wash via the website. It took Joseph, the owner, a day to get back (note: better to just call). I ended up scheduling an appointment for the next morning at 8:30 am as his schedules are all booked up. Once I arrived the next morning at 7:53 am, I saw this tall and big yet friendly and congenial man walk over. He introduced himself as Joseph. He had his help Amber there too. As he started the wash, I understood why everything unfolded the way it did. joseph gets down and gets his own hands dirty to ensure your car is spanking clean despite his worker doing the job. He is not the typical boss bossing people around and standing in front of the computer trying to flip more washes. His commitment to honesty and making sure customers dont come and wait long hours really resonates with my own as a fellow entrepreneur soldier. Needless to say, the car came out really clean. Will definitely recommend and come again.",Positive
"This is a fantastic car wash / detailing company! My car always comes out looking like new! In addition, the staff & owner are always able to work around my schedule. Can't recommend highly enough! (Also really like the fact that Attention to Detail is a local company - it's nice to support our Chambana economy.) As another reviewer mentioned, they really care about their work and your vehicle :D",Positive
"My husband and I recently purchased a used minivan that had not been cleaned very well. The last week of Illinois winter weather we have had this year did not help the interior either. We did some price comparisons around town for interior detailing and were blown away by how expensive it can get. Not only was Attention to Detail VERY reasonably priced, but they also cleaned and waxed the outside for us, which was a very pleasant surprise. They treated our van as if it were their own. They completely worked around my schedule, offering a shuttle service and allowing me to pick the date and times of service, drop off and pick up. We will definitely be using them again and recommending their services to friends and families. Honestly, I had to download the yelp app to write this review. I have never written an online review, but we were so blown away by their ""attention to detail,"" and professionalism. They did everything they could to make sure we were happy. Thank you Attention to Detail for such a great experience. We look forward to working with you in the future!",Positive
"My boyfriend just got his car detailed here and he had a great experience all around. We were a little nervous about this place since there were no reviews online, but his initial phone call to ask about pricing convinced both of us that it would be a good choice. He had called a couple of other places to ask about prices and people only seemed annoyed by his call. When he called Attention to Detail they were nice from the beginning and seemed to actually care about getting his business and doing the best job they could. The main concern was the interior of the car that was filthy - seats completely stained, crumbs and stains on the carpet, fingerprints on the windows, and dust and grime on the dashboard and controls. There are many different options and prices, but he chose the $98 service to focus on the interior of the car. This package included a basic car wash and a deep clean of the interior. It's a little more expensive than other places we called, but I have no doubt the services are better and the people are nicer. I cannot believe they got the car so clean compared to how dirty it was. Not to mention they sent updates on the progress of the car and even offered a (free) shuttle service so that it could be done while he was at work. They tried to get him to upgrade to get his engine and exterior waxed and cleaned as well. He passed this time around because it was about $60 more, but based on this experience I am confident it would be worth it. The car looks and smells amazing and I would highly recommend Attention to Detail!",Positive
"I just had a quick call into the service department. I have recently bought a used A4 and it's about time to do the timing belt so I figured I'd call and see what the dealer had done. Michael was able to give me a couple notes of the service history but it had been a while so they were lacking. In any case he didn't have to help me and was friendly, thanks again Michael.",Positive
"I recently replaced my 2012 Audi Q5 brakes with after-market brakes. Right after, I started to hear some clanging noises coming from my front brakes. I immediately took it to a mechanic and they could not figure it out. So I decided to let the Audi professionals find out the issues. The left rotors were 0.14 under the minimal thickness so they came back at me with a bill to replace front brakes and rotors for $928.87 or a diagnostic fee of $170. My heart dropped, I gladly paid the diagnostic fee and got the hell out of there. After picking up my car, my brakes were rattling even more. I then took my car to Mr. Brakes on Jones Blvd, they saw that the after-market brake pads I bought were crap. The after-market brakes were not secure and were moving back and forth, thus making the clanging noises. He also saw that the undercarriage was taken apart and not put back properly which was making all the extra noises. So I guess if you do not fix your car at Audi, they could care less if they put everything back together correctly. Once I replaced the brakes with OEM pads, my car works perfectly fine now for the fraction of the price. Always get a 2nd opinion!",Negative

Just pulled in here on vacation on of our indicator lights came on so I was concerned what wonderful service we got here right away being given cold waters to drink by Nate who is extremely hospitable assuring us they would get us a car for the day so we didn't waist a minute of our vacation time great service very professional if you live in Vegas this would be the first place to shop for your car,Positive
"in January 26, I trade-in Toyota,Camry 2007 to Audi A4 2009 in Audi Las Vegas they gave me for my Toyota 4,932.72$ and I add 5,404.31$ in Cash total 10,337.03$ two days after The brakes in the car did not function well and the wheel and the car was shaking I came back to the agency I was completely shocked that they even sell me something like this they jeopardize my Family life.The technician even said that the breaks is completely dead end it came with another five issues in the car they offer us to repair the brakes and The other issues and pay for the repair we said we not going to pay nothing because we just bought the car two days ago so the only thing that we going to do is get a refund for the car because we did have five days cancellation they didn't want us to refund the car so they offer us to fix the brakes and The starter for free they said that the important stuff like the breaks and The starter is dangerous to drive with so they're going to fix it for free but the other stuff they would not fix for free then Glenn ( The sales person) says that if the car have any more issues in the next 60 days they gonna repair it or replace the car so don't worry was the exact word after 6 weeks The Wheel start shaking and the car is shaking we decided to come back and replace the car The car was there for a week after week they said that it's what they told us in the beginning and the technician Charles said that is something then not gonna last long to drive wait around 30.000 mile we ask for them to replace the car ( like Glenn promise in the next 60 days) and then they said they going to give us ridiculous amount of 4500$and the said that they offering this price because the car have issues( issues that you sold us six weeks ago) and Manager Mary sitting behind her desk in her office not even coming to talk to us sending Glenn the sales person back-and-forth and when you want to speak with someone higher then her she saying there is no one higher then her I said there is no way so they told me there is Darren is going to be here tomorrow and he's less pleasant than her and Darren is the biggest liar and deceiving this is why all the salesperson in Audi Las Vegas are liars because is the biggest liar there they have a good example this is the definition of a fraud they basically steal from me 5837$ and nobody can help me with this not even Audi USA customer support this is a big company with a big-name but in the minute that you bought ""they fuck you over"" and then there is no one to talk with",Negative
Poor service by management in sales department. For a no haggle place it took forever to get a price on a q6. I feel I wasted almost an hour and a half of my life. The topper was that the sales manager came out and said to me people think they have better credit scores than they really do. That's a major turn off and I knew I wasn't going to buy a vehicle there. I walked out and went up the road and purchased a car from a different dealership. Their loss.,Negative
"Do you know the adage ""how can you tell the difference between a porcupine and an Audi?"" Well, now we get it. We didn't think we were Audi people, but wife was just not happy with her Acura MDX and they got such great reviews that we had to check them out. So we headed into Audi of Las Vegas. My wife did NOT want to be there. She didn't want to like an Audi. We sat down with Jocelyn and she went over our must haves, our wish list items and even those things that we didn't want or wouldn't accept. We took a Q7 out for a test drive and loved it. We weren't ready to buy that night and Jocelyn didn't pressure us at all. She had our requirements and started looking for a vehicle that met our requirements. Life decided to tell us to take a break when my wife had a heart attack the very next day (she's fully recovered now and just fine.) Jocelyn stayed in touch with us. She gave us space while my wife recovered and wasn't pushy at all. If she came across a vehicle she thought we might be interested in, she'd e-mail us both purchase and lease estimates. She's also provide us with the assumptions behind those estimates (interest rates for purchase, money factor/residual for leases.) We were used to the larger SUV, but while the Q7 was nice, something still didn't feel right. We decided to go down a size to see if we could get a good combination of personality, get-up-and-go along with some practicality. After talking to Jocelyn, she recommended we focus in on the 3.0L Q5. We took that out of a test drive and it was nice. After that test drive, we met Patrick, Jocelyn's sales manager. He talked to us a little bit trying to get a feel for what we were looking for and again, was not pushy. Like Jocelyn, he was more interested in getting us into the right vehicle than in making a sale that day. In talking to both Jocelyn and Patrick, we discussed our concerns. The Q5 was nice, but it felt like we were settling. The Q7 didn't seem quite right either. Patrick suggested taking a recently-arrived SQ5 out for a test drive. The moment we saw it we knew this was going to be trouble, um, I mean different. About halfway through the test drive my wife looked at me and said ""I'm done."" It was the one. From there it was pretty quick. We were able to finalize the price in about 30 minutes - none of this ""going to the desk and standing there shooting the breeze while we make the customers sweat"" action. Darin, the general manager, even stopped by and thanked us for our business. We got into Finance quickly. We discussed some add ons, but again nothing pushy. (Here's a tip - if you add Audi Care, it actually reduces the price of the lease because it increases the residual of the vehicle.) Post-sale, Jocelyn kept us posted on the status of the ""green slip"" and has answered all of our questions about the car. We have NO buyers remorse and my wife loves driving her new car. And yes, we've had a few ""Audi driver"" moments - and they were glorious!",Positive
This audi dealership is the first audi dealership who won't give a complimentary car wash. I was expecting more from an audi dealer. Good thing that AUDI HENDERSON gave me a good complimentary wash. I will never go to audi Las Vegas on Sahara. I will give my business and 'two thumbs up' to audi henderson.,Negative
Had a great experience purchasing two vehicles at Audi LV!!! Marvin Dodd and Amber Mills are absolutely amazing. The level of customer service and expertise is unparalleled. They are passionate about these cars and amazing when it comes to going the extra mile to make sure you are taken care of!,Positive
I had to take the time to write a review. Eric in the service dept is worth commending. He did everything that could be done to make a bummer situation as smooth as possible. Such great customer service!! Thank you! :),Positive
"They are upfront and don't jerk you around here,they have fair prices and don't try to rip you off on the trade either.No hidden fees or scams like half the dealers out there...... My sales guy Marc Carpenter spent all the time I needed to find the right car for me.Got a decent deal without the usual stress of car shopping.No sales pressure at all and they actually know about the cars and features in detail.Will go back as long as they continue to do it right! Now my 3rd car I purchased here over the last 8 years or so,hopefully more down the road.",Positive
I went to them for a used car and I was so impressed by their customer service. Ask for Marc he will take care of you!! He helped us and went out of his way to find us a car. By far the best service I've received from a car dealership.,Positive
"Dealt with Carlos Brasil and had an extremely positive experience. Was very knowledgeable, helpful and professional...not the stereotype of a car salesman at all. I would deal with Carlos and recommend him 100%!",Positive
"My husband and I had the pleasure of purchasing a pre-owned Audi A8 from the Audi dealership on West Sahara. We just recently started looking for a vehicle, and was dreading the hassle of haggling for the right price for the vehicle we wanted. We were told that there was an Audi A8 for sale that was in excellent condition at Audi Las Vegas, so we decided to go take a look. Our salesperson was Amber Mills. She was so professional and patient with us. She was pleasant to work with and we didn't feel any pressure to buy anything. The one thing I appreciated was the fact that not only did she sell Audi, but she was the proud owner of several of the vehicles herself. She really believes in the product! We got the car for a great price, and the transaction was simple and seamless. The great service from Amber didn't end when we purchased our vehicle, she has followed up with us several times to answer any questions and ensured that we were completely satisfied. We were so impressed with our experience, that we will probably be purchasing a second vehicle from them really soon. If you are in the market for an Audi (new or used), I would recommend asking for Amber Mills, she will treat you right.",Positive
Great experience - we bought a car sight unseen and it was everything they said it was and more. The whole process was made easy by their team. I will be going back to Audi Las Vegas for my next car.,Positive
"I generally make the drive to Audi Henderson as I've received top of the line service there and every department is very detail oriented. This time both locations were out of loaner cars so I came to Sahara as it is closer to me. Every one of these stars is for Don Harrison. Not only did he rearrange my appointment so that I would be able to use a rental (and forego the hassle of renting a car), he was just so personable he made my day and I left smiling. Funny side story, I met up with my Fiance after visiting the dealership and he noticed I was in a great mood. As I started to explain there was a guy in service that made my day he interrupted me and said, ""Oh, was it Don? Yeah, I really like that guy"". He'd also just gotten off of the phone with Don to schedule an appointment. How funny is that? Steve at the Henderson location is fantastic and I love dealing with him but apparently my Fiance will only go to the Sahara location now because he's a fan of Don!",Positive
"Yes you are seeing stars. This is definitely as good as it gets. 28th Sept. It is 1920 and I just got off the phone with Service manager Stephanie. Didn't I just turn in the survey requesting to speak to a manager 30 minutes ago? D*mn she's fast. (Houston we just located Wonder Woman and she's in the service department of Audi Las Vegas). lol The follow up call took place because of some current of events that happened during my first visit. When I picked up my car after the revised review, Mario and Billy stressed their deepest apologies about how that visit went. As you saw in my original review, there were some issues, that have since been resolved, that restricted me from rating my experience with 5 stars. Explained to me that Audi has very high standards whether it be from sales, or from the service department, the overal experience falls back on the team as a whole. I reached out in my Audi survey. Sept. 28th 2015 at about 1840 is when I took the survey. At about 1900 is when their service department called back. It makes a difference when the whole team is involved. Granted it took me to do my survey to get attention, and shine the light where needed, I had to show my appreciation and voice it to the right person. Thank you Mario for directing me in the right direction, and for Billy doing his best to instill that trust back into me. I have yet to purchase a vehicle from this dealership, but if the service department staff fights to keep their clientele in good standings the way this team did, then I wouldn't see why it would be any different in their sales team. Good job Audi.",Positive
"Audi has the best customer service ever!! Amber is the best car salesperson I have ever worked with before when buying/leasing a car! She is so sweet and helpful.... she doesn't make you feel pressured into buying anything.. she is amazing !!! I highly recommend contacting her if you are looking for a new Audi, you will not be disappointed!!!",Positive
"Carlos is Amazing, he spent hours helping me find & finalize buying the exact car used car, I wanted:) My mom had to go into the hospital that that afternoon. So he made sure we wrapped up all the paperwork quickly & efficiently! Wished me & my mom well, then said don't worry, u can bring it buy the dealership & we'll take care a few things we had discussed, that wasn't in the paperwork. Like detailing it, filling the tank & helping me learn a few thing about the car. Being raised here in Vegas, I wasn't sure they really would or not? After spending 3days inthe hospital with my mom, I was shocked when Carlos call me to Thank me for buying the car, hoped I really enjoyed driving it & reminded me to bring the car by when I had time. He even asked how my mom was doing:) When I got to Audi on tue afternoon, they got my car right in & did a great job, Carlos made me feel like I just bought some highly expensive luxury vehicle, not one of the cheapest used cars they had at a special sales event. He showed me no matter what you buy he will treat you like VIP, because he really cares about all of his clients:)",Positive
"This review is for both Amber Mllls and the service department. I went in to test drive an A4 last month (wishing, but not really expecting to buy it due to the price). Amber worked hard to figure out a payment that was right for me and was extremely personable. I had to visit the service department for my tint as well as to buff out some small scratches. Billy, and his team were awesome! Highly recommended.",Positive
"Just bought a certified pre owned Audi A4 today. I didn't intend on buying a car today, but after looking online I found the model in the color I wanted fully loaded with everything. Me and my husband went in just to ""test drive"" it then come walking out with a new car LOL. I traded in my 2013 scion TC which had 58k on it. (We're from California so we drive a lot) I put $0 down out of pocket just the trade in and walked out with a pretty reasonable payment. Amber was more than great and really patient and helpful and very very knowledgeable with audis . She made the whole experience a great one and if my husband does decide to get an A5 we will definitely use her again. So excited to finally upgrade to such a beautiful car!",Positive
Great buying experience from a knowledgable and friendly staff with no high pressure sales tactics. Highly recommend dealing with Gareth and / or Kim,Positive
i purchased my audi q5 from audi las vegas & i have sent everyone interested in audis there. i love my car & most importantly their dealership is the best as well as their service dept. they are amazing in customer service & very knowledge. boyd brown is one of the best service consultants that i have ever dealt with. they are great with accommodating & arranging whenever i need a loaner as well. very prompt service & all around great experience with audi of las vegas!!,Positive
"Great service from start to finish! Made appt. online with Erik and requested loaner car. Reply came quickly. Dropped off car at appointed time and was advised car would be ready early afternoon. Called be Erik early afternoon and picked up car which, in addition to requested service, was washed and cleaned! Good customer focus and professional handling~",Positive
I just purchased a Q5 and I must say that the experience in purchasing it couldn't have been any easier. First of all Kim Beck my sales rep worked with me to get the monthly payment that I was comfortable with and had me in and out in less than an hour. I am now going to advise everybody at my office to get an Audi and from Kim.,Positive
"Customer service at its finest! Granted, it may be what you pay for, but it still makes a difference that they successfully come through with great service. I highly recommend Michael Pyon, as he was extremely patient, helpful, and honest with my family, making my first car buying experience an absolute win. I purchased a new Audi A3 through their college grad finance plan, which really helped me get a car I still can't believe I have. It's pretty sweet, to say the least. Thank you so much Michael, and Audi. I've fallen in love with the car, and the brand! After this experience, I think they've made me an Audi driver for life.",Positive
"I recently purchased an Audi A3 from this dealership and could not be more pleased with not only the vehicle, but the service provided to me throughout the process. My primary points of contact were Doug and Michael, and both of them embodied the true meaning behind ""customer service."" Doug was my initial point of contact. I have to admit, I was initially hesitant as I was not 100% keen on purchasing a new vehicle and was more just a ""curious shopper"". However, through both his friendliness and attentiveness to my criteria, he convinced me to come down to the dealership to discuss what we might be able to do. Once I arrived, I met with a teammate of Doug's named Michael. Michael was extremely helpful, and his no-pressure, informative approach really made me start feeling good about a purchase. When we got into the pricing and negotiation phase, I really felt like he was on my side and put forth great efforts to meet my needs while still looking out for the best interest of his company. Between the team of Doug and Michael, I can say it was not only one of the best car buying experiences I have had, but one of the best sales experiences I have had in general. It resulted in the purchase of my vehicle and more than likely earned a life-long Audi customer.",Positive
"I never in my life thought I would be bait and switched at an Audi dealership. Especially not considering that this is the 3rd car I bought from them. I would have thought as a repeat customer they might have a bit more sense when it came to retention but I would be wrong. Now let me preface this by saying I know Audi's. This is my 8th and there isn't much I don't know about the car. I can't rebuild the engine, but I'm not checking out the cup holders and I don't need my daddy with me to buy a car. Although this time I needed my mommy. She was co-signing, as I had gone back to freelancing after being with a studio for a while, and didn't have a long enough current work history. I could have gotten it by myself, but the interest would have been higher. I had originally looked to replace my lease in LA, but my mom couldn't make it down so I went back to Desert Audi. I explained a number of times to the guy that the reason I was buying the Audi again was the space I had with the seats down for transporting my photo gear while still having a car large and nice enough to transport clients. He even tried to sell me a Q5 based on that statement. We haggled back and forth over the color. I didn't want a white car, but that's all they had at this particular location. I was about to walk away and all of a sudden they were able to locate a car in silver at another location, but the car wouldn't be able to get to the Sahara location until later that evening. By the time the car arrived and I was able to make it back to the dealership it was dark, I looked the car over for any signs of damage and took delivery of the vehicle. The next morning in the way back to Los Angeles I got my first surprise. The visor was broken on the driver side. I was too far away to drive back to have it repaired but I did call to inform the dealership of the damage. I was told to find a dealer in LA and they would replace it at no charge. Inconvenient but not that big of a deal I suppose. Although I would expect more from a brand new car. Then I get a call from the dealership informing me that they had contracted me for the wrong car and we would need to fill out a new contract for the car I had. As I was working and unable to come back to Vegas at the time, my mother went filled out the paperwork. Had I known that a huge bait and switch was happening and I was about to get screwed in ways I had not even thought possible I might have quit the job and driven straight back to Vegas. My next surprise came when I went to pick up some additional photo equipment for a shoot I had. The tripods were longer than what would fit in the backseat so like always I go to put the seat down so I can put them through, but for some reason can't figure out how they go down. Call the dealership and the lady at the service department looks up my car and informs me that he seats don't go down in that particular model. Excuse me? The seats on the white one I was shown and initially contracted for had seats that went down. This was supposed to be the same car just another color. Who even knew they made cars without seat that didn't go down. Again this is my 8th Audi. At this point having just completed a series of commercials for Audi I threaten to call the Audi corporate in Germany. The General Manager calls me back after 9 calls, and says he'll look into it. 18 calls later and a threat to drive the thing through the showroom window someone calls me back to inform me that that particular GM is no longer there. Cut to 6 months later and I bring the car up to have another insignificant thing that has broken fixed on the car, and since I'm stuck there I decide to chat with the new GM. He at least seems concerned about what has occurred and makes an effort to correct the problem. Now though it's a matter if breaking the lease and not getting charged a fine and starting a new lease all over again. Fine. No problem. But he's going to talk to corporate and try to get me out if the lease with no penalties so he has to wait till Monday to call them. Fine. Monday comes and I'm informed all of corporate is in meetings until Wednesday. Okay whatever. But he promises to call by Friday. That was in September. I'm still waiting for that call. At this point I've given up and will suffer through this lease for the next 2 years, but they have lost a 10 year customer, and I'm considering for the first time in 22 years moving to a different brand. Because of the issue with the seats I now have to rent a car every time I work and paying $500 a month for a car payment and then another $300 for a car rental is cutting into my income. If I could spend $800 a month on a car I'd be driving a Tesla and not paying for gas. Tomorrow the car is going in for service... Again. Let's see what gets broken this time.",Negative
"I had a pleasant, pressure-free experience at Audi of Las Vegas when I recently purchased a car there. I bought my last 2 cars at Carmax because I was weary of the same old salesman pitches trying to sell me a car. I was hesitantly walking to the door expecting to be bombarded by salesmen anxious to get my business. Instead, I was politely greeted by Arman who simply asked if there was anything in particular I needed help with and if there was a specific car I wanted to see. I knew exactly what features I wanted in the vehicle and he respected that fact. He was not pushy at all. However, his manager did offer to sell me a quattro for a deep discount. I declined it because I felt that I did not really need it and i wanted to stay within budget. Should I have taken the offer? IDK. They even fixed a broken license plate holder on my wife's audi for us. The part alone would've costed $211. The manager's jaw dropped when the service department told us that was the cost for the part. He took care of it for us and saved us some money. Well, I guess I did buy a car from him afterall, LOL. Because the weather was looking like it was going to rain, he told us to bring BOTH cars back for a free wash. Much appreciated! My wife had a lengthy conversation with their manager in regards to their poor track record on review sites. He was aware of it and said they are trying to do things better and give Audi owners and prospective buyers the best experience possible. We were happy with the service and will be returning for future needs.",Positive
I brought my 2nd Audi in 5 months from the sales rep Aaron Smith. He's great. We flew in to town he picked us up from the airport. All of our paperwork was in place and we we in our brand new car driving off within an hours time. We were made to feel a part of the family.,Positive
"Great customer service. Purchased a used Boxster though them and the price was fair, the experience was smooth and without hassle, and they were honest and easy to deal with. Even helped me to set up shipping for out of state delivery. Very highly recommended.",Positive
"I did not purchase a vehicle, however, I feel compelled to write a scathing review - not doing so would be a disservice to anyone who blindly walks into this dealership. That was my first mistake. Two years ago I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. I encountered a salesman by the name of Steve Blackwell. I made it clear that I purchase a vehicle every couple years and although, my vehicle (a 2013 Mercedes ML 350) at the time was not paid off I was seriously considering buying something new. Steve spent well over an hour discussing purchase and lease options on a hybrid Cayenne with myself and my significant other. I wanted to discuss the options thoroughly with my significant other before making a decision. We went home and did so. Fast forward to the following week. My significant other and I both contacted Steve multiple times to make an offer. It's important that I add that I was willing to work with the numbers. Steve failed to call us back and when I finally spoke with him he had a variety of excuses for his lack of professionalism - ""I was in the hospital"", ""The VIN number you gave me for your vehicle was incorrect"", ""I don't have proof of your insurance"", etc... I emailed him all of the information he claimed he did not have and he told me he would get back to me. I never heard from him again. It was bad business and as you can tell it has left a sour taste in my mouth. I did what any savvy woman would do and walked one block down on Baum Boulevard and formed a lasting relationship with the Rahal sales team at Mercedes Benz of Pittsburgh. I'd like to add that they gladly accepted $90,000 of my money this past July so that I could be the first person in the Pittsburgh area to own a 2018 400 E 4matic Coupe . I have heard many friends rave about their wonderful experiences with Auto Palace. After the fact, all of my friends informed me that I should only deal with the manager Aaron since it was he who provided exceptional service to them when they were in the process of purchasing. So Aaron if you are reading this feel free to reach out to me when I'm in the market for a new vehicle again - that may be the only way I'd consider walking into Auto Palace again. For those of you who took the time to read this and still decide to go to this dealership do not do so in vain - blackball the aforementioned salesman.",Negative
"Terrible customer service from the salesman. Went to look at a cayenne turbo, liked the car and was will to work with the number. The salesman said the best he could do was $100 off. What a joke.",Negative
Excellent warranty service and follow up. I have a 6 month old Macan and it needed some warranty work. They immediately knew what clam shell noise I as complaining about and replicated it without a test drive. The squeaky steering column was also diagnosed as a known issue and parts were immediately ordered from Germany. Every effort was expended to search for the steering part in the US but was determined to be an item from Germany. They ensured that I got my car back whilst waiting for the part. I would certainly come here for service since it is only a short distance from downtown. The shuttle was efficient and drivers courteous.,Positive
"I had always been a bit intimidated by this place, with its very high end Porsches and even some exotics. I had a problem with my 1991 928GT and so I brought it here since it was so close by. I was so pleasantly surprised by the high quality, attentive, and humble service. I can recommend Auto Palace without reservation. This is a fine establishment that treats its customers well and with respect.",Positive
"I came in here to replace my headlight...... It was $17. That is$6 more than Wal-Mart which is right across the street. The service seemed ok, but wow, what a huge mark up. Shop around and save some money Only come here in an emergency, yikes",Negative
I am a bit baffled by the negative reviews on here as I have never received anything short of exceptional customer service. Particularly impressive is Cesario. His knowledge and level of professionalism have me returning to this location whenever my car requires it. Highly recommended.,Positive
One star goes to the friendly staff. Other than that I was sold the wrong part. I won't ever be back since this is NOT THE FIRST TIME I've been sold the wrong part at one of these chains.,Negative
"The worst. First of all I know what I needed. I did not ask for any help. However, when I needed to check out, there was no one at the counter. After waiting five minutes, I asked if anyone was here. Repeated once more. A voice front the back said, "" be with you in a moment sir"". No problem, that's cool. A guy comes out, no hello, no smile, just attitude. He asked me if it was cash or credit. I answered, and I thought that he had not heard me. So, I repeated, credit. I apologized to him, ""I thought that you didn't hear me."" No response. At that point, I was convinced that this guy has a problem. As I left, I asked for his name. Donald he said. I come to this Autozone all of the time. Never again. I am a veteran, I am used to rude people, however this guy got my blood up, this guy don't want that.",Negative
Had a few parts to return and brought my original parts in the store. The guy who helped me was so rude CSR#11 On my receipt. I asked him if he liked his job and he started yelling at me. We were in a yelling argument in the store and I was simply stating he needs to find another job because his customer skills are horrible. Never will Auto Zone get my business too many helpful auto parts places with great service. I feel like because I was a woman he completely disregarded me. Poor service,Negative
"This has to be the worst Autozone I have ever in my entire life stepped foot in! I've always lived in the Green Valley/Henderson area and the service in this area is impeccable state of the art! This Rainbow location has the most rude, unhelpful, inconsiderate and most unorganized store! The manager after I was waiting 15 minutes to get help walked away after servicing another client. The tech that finally assisted me said he had no idea about a rear light for my car that I had to tell him twice the make/model because he was not paying attention! I walked out and will never step foot in there! Now I have to drive 30 minutes out of my way to get some good help! I would advise you partner witg THE GV/Henderson managers and get tips on training your team!",Negative
"This autozone has to be one of the most friendliest, organized stores I've ever been to. Manuel Carvajal helped me with a battery installation and also helped me with my wiper blades. He also helped me with my fuel problem I had horrible gas mileage and he offered me a fuel treatment that was on sale and it helped with my problem. I was so pleased with his services I tried to offer him a tip and he told me he wasn't allowed to take it. I was very upset that I couldn't reward him for his hard work but he told me that. me happy and coming back is worth more then a tip. Would highly recommend this store to anyone.",Positive
"This is a f@#cking terrible autozone! They ordered our rotors days ago said it was transferring from in town but they aren't here they don't know anything or have any answers. When we came last time the computer said they had an inventory of 3 but couldn't find them now this. And now the managers pissy because we want him to call the other store that says they have it, to confirm for us before driving our car that distance.",Negative
This is the worst AutoZone location I have ever been to. The employees are rude and none of them like to help. I went to do a return on a product that the employee recommended that ended up being the wrong part and when I went to return it at 7:30 pm they said I couldn't return it because they closed the registers and the store doesn't close till 9:00 pm. All while these two not so helpful men jus laughed and talked. Wish I would have read their name tags because their attitude is no way I would want my employees treating our customers. Hopefully auto zone reads this and compares it to who was working this day at this time (I jus walked out of the store and did the review in my car after being talked to that way by somewhere I chose to shop) autozone definitely lost my business.,Negative
Dear autozone! Thank you for making me feel like a COMPLETE idiot for asking for a snow brush/ice scrapper for my car and for informing me if I was in Colorado then they would stock it or have those to sell. 1. I know I live in Las Vegas but thanks for being condescending. 2. 3 grown adult men laughing at me. Nice grow up 3. News flash-Mt. Charleston/Red Rock canyon and surrounding valley areas do get snow and our windshields can be icy in the early mornings. To the employees at this location thanks for telling me to check at Walmart. Poor customer service with lots of attitude.,Negative
"I was looking for windshield wipers today, and the passenger side windshield wiper appeared to be out of stock. One of the employees named Carlos looked for it to see if it was in stock, and he found one for me in the back. The wipers came with multiple parts and instead of leaving me to figure out how to put them on, Carlos assembled them and put them on my vehicle. Superb service, friendly staff... And so helpful! A time saver and a life saver!!! Thank you for your help Carlos! I really appreciate how helpful this store is!",Positive
I came to get my headlight changed. They looked up the correct light while the mechanic took out the old one. I was literally in and out in less then 10 min. So awesome!! Really nice guys. They know what their doing and aren't trying to take advantage.,Positive
"So I don't know a lot about cars and I just needed someone to help me put in the transmission fluid I purchased. I went to this autozone and asked if someone would please help me put the fluid in mar car. This bigger lady that worked there said if you didn't buy it here, we can't help you. I understood this but still felt it wasn't friendly. So I then asked if someone could just point out to me where to put in the fluid so I could do it myself. This young guy with glasses that worked there reluctantly agreed to show me. When we went outside and I popped my head, he then told me I don't know where it is and laughed. NO HELP WHATSOEVER! And kind of rude!",Negative
"I was having major electrical issues with my Cadillac. I went in one morning and the guys working literally were taking apart the electrical (which is a huge pain in a GM) and found the issue with my car. I would have never figured it out. We found out it was a custom order piece ($$$), the guys even told me where I can find the part for a tenth of a price and showed me how to install it which was insanely easy. Very happy with the service I receive each time I come in here. I have three different autozones closer to my house but I'll drive a few extra miles for good service.",Positive
"Meh!!!! I'm not a car person by any means, I hear wonderful things about Auto Zone, but to me they are not much better then a Walmart. I've been to two different store in the last few months and I go in knowing nothing and leave knowing less. Maybe its just the female in me but yeah nothing to write home about. I'll stick to Google for any automotive question i may have in the future.",Negative
an employee named jordan shorter chunky mexican maybe Asian mix in there store on 3/18/2018 physically threatened me with violence for carrying an supporting firearms saying He is an oct 1st survivor an when he hears ppl talking about guns he wants to get up an punch them in the fucking face i believe they have yet to fire this mentally disturbed person so i will refuse to shop at this autozone till he is gone,Negative
"Went in to get a new battery because my car wouldn't start and the customer service was amazing! They checked and my battery was under warrantee so they just did the exchange and then put the new battery in for me. Great, friendly employees and great service!",Positive
"Sooo rude! Like absolutely condescending. I go to take my truck in for a new battery as i feel it is going out. The gentleman had no clue how to test my battery. ""I've never seen it like this before"". It's a battery. I don't have a foreign car dude. It's a Chevy. Like what the heck. Just put my stuff back together and I'll go to another one. He had the audacity to say ""well would you change something that you have never seen before"". I guess I'm confused how you work for autozone but don't know squat about different batteries. I'll go to the one on skypoint like planned. Should have went with my gut !",Negative
"Check engine light came on yesterday and my favorite guy, Ryan at Big O was off so I got my diagnostic check here (it's free). Thanks Auto Zone! Paul helped me and he said it's either the spark plugs or ignition coils. Came back today to purchase the spark plugs after speaking to Ryan and Jordan helped me find the right ones at another location. Friendly and helpful employees at this location. Even Chris from Vegas and Buffalo when I picked up the spark plugs. He even suggested I purchase a fuel cleaner to help with the problem my car was experiencing. Took his advice since it only cost $4.99. Whatever it takes to keep my car in tip-top condition. Thanks to the 3 of you for helping me!",Positive
Best customer service! Went in to get engine oil and brake light and it was very fast and they helped me get the right stuff.,Positive
This AutoZone is worthless. They never have anything in stock. The battery machines or basically anything you need is always broken or unavailable. Never had so much dissatisfaction from a store let alone an AutoZone.,Negative
"I came in here Sunday afternoon for power steering fluid for my boyfriends 94 forerunner. Two younger looking dudes who worked there were at the counter talking away and ignored me despite the fact I was standing near them and kept trying to ask a question. When I finally was able to ask a question, they had no idea what I was talking about and pointed me in what turned it to be the wrong direction. An older guy named Larry finally asked me if I needed help and I was able to ask him, he corrected me on something I was confused on and did it in a way that was totally polite and informative and the best part was he wasn't sexist! I feel like he told me the same info he would have told a dude, and that's rare in car shops. He also quoted George Lopez and was super funny. Thanks Larry, you're the man!",Positive
I walked in and asked for someone to check my battery. Rick was quickly outside with the battery tester and when we found that my battery was bad (which I thought was probably the case) he not only put the battery in for me but cleaned the battery connections and made sure it was ready to go. He was amazing!! I would go back to this AutoZone anytime! THANKS RICK!!!,Positive
"I have never in my life been to another AutoZone with such horrible customer service... and I have been to MANY! You can almost say I frequent AutoZone, so when I come into a location for assistance imagine my dismay when the service staff, all 3 of them, acted like it was an ok inconvenience to help me. I was there for a check engine light scan, yes there were several people in line so I was happy to wait for the lines to clear. What I wasn't happy about was having someone tell me to wai, another person tell me to wait and the a third person, after I had been standing there for 15 minutes, tell me the scanner was broken. Really people? The first schmuck who told me to wait and rolled his eyes at me couldn't have mentioned the scanner was broken? Or the second guy who sighed at me also couldn't have mentioned it? Seriously? Then the third guy mentioned the next closest AutoZone and absolutely botched the cross streets. Smh! Epic customer service fail.",Negative
"Ok, so Im an Autozone connoisseur LOL. But for real though. I frequent them! This one is def not my fave. Here you walk in and they have an attitude like ""what do you want?"" and there I go, knowing my shit... yet they dont! I understand they are not mechanics, but wtf, you dont know a damned thing about card?! Thats like going to a computer store and saying ""Uhhh I dont know, but do you wanna buy some memory!?"" NEGATIVE COWBOY! Anyway, Ive put in an application at Autozone and alas never got a call back... its too bad, I know more then these fools! Plush Im super fun and have a nice rack that will sell a mouse trap to a mouse! Also, go online, 99% of the time you can find the product cheaper on autozone.com you may have to wait 7 days but for 30$ ill take it, plus I wont have to deal with these monkeys!",Negative
"I walked in looking for a panel clip for my car because mine is worn out. The guy at the counter did move and show me where i could find it, but i didn't and he didn't help me after that.. then i walked around looking for someone else to help me because god forbid the guy who was at the counter be disturbed again!! anyhow.. i'm going to pepboys next time.. I still haven't found the darn piece i needed after leaving there.",Negative
"Addison sat down with me and went over parts and labor in detail. Because I was paying cash he encouraged me to try and find as many salvage parts as I could. This knocked at least $500 off my repair, some of which was labor. He got me out the door for a good price. Hopefully I won't need auto body repair again any time soon, but if I do I'll definitely be going here.",Positive
Addison supper friendly guy! You feel like family the moment you walk in! My car was damage from a car accident and he kept me up to date about what was going on with my car. I definitely recommend them!My car actually looks better than before the accident that's how good they are!,Positive
"Addison is absolutely amazing, he will always go out of his way to help a customer. He has always made sure my vehicle is taken care of and will do an outstanding job. His employees are also all very professional and friendly. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my auto needs!",Positive
"Addison and the team at ACS are amazing. I brought my car to them on Monday and within a week it was perfect. He constantly kept me updated on the progress and made sure I was completely satisfied when I picked up my car. He went above and beyond my expectations of getting my car back in shape. I would recommend anyone to ACS, great customer service, perfect turn around time and amazing body work!!",Positive
Had the very best experience here today!! Was actually out running an errand and was a little lost. Pulled into ACS to turn around and it was my lucky day. I had been wanting to get a huge scratch across the back bumper checked out (figured it was from a shopping cart driven by a questionable operator!). GM Addison had it buffed out (thanks Rambo!) free of charge! He removed about 95% of the scratches out!! While I waited - they did it on the spot- Addison and I had a lovely chat. Can't thank you enough!! Jenn C.,Positive
The Workers at Automotive Collision Services are well beyond that of any other company. I have never seen the care and ability to detail that they give to all their customers. It is difficult to find mechanics you can trust but I can ensure that these mechanics would never steer you in the wrong direction. They always make sure to do what is best for the customer which is rare these days.,Positive
"I met with Addison who did an estimate on my car, which was hit a little while back. His estimate didn't match mine from the car insurance company. He was able to match my estimate which made me very happy. Not only that but when I came to pick up my car, which looked amazing by the way, he had also cleaned my car inside and out! The service was amazing the work was amazing I would recommend to all.",Positive
Addison was great. Offers great prices and actually cares about you and your vehicle. ACS is a genuine company and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for any type of work to be done on their car.,Positive
"Friendly, helpful and honest owner. He let me leave car at his store for 1 month free. He also checks the damage of the car and give the estimate of costs to fix it. He will give you his opinion about should you fix the car or not. And all of those are free. No cost at all! Highly recommend this store and the friendly owner!",Positive
I got in a car accident at the end of January. Automotive collision services came out the same day to expect my car and made sure I was well taken care of during the time that it was being repaired. I was often updated with the status of my car and just really felt genuinely cared for. I highly recommend this establishment and will be returning if I have ever future repairs. Thank you guys so much.,Positive
"The towing company next door had left my damaged car in the middle of Smith Road. As I was waiting for another tow truck, the owner of this shop came out to help me. It was after his store hours, so on his own time, he not only took a look at the damage that was done to my car, but allowed me to have the tow truck tow it into his yard. He offered me water and gave me a tour of his garage so I could see where my car would be kept. Unfortunately, the insurance company declared my car totaled, so the owner graciously did not charge me for storing the car or for the inspection and quote. I would highly recommend his services to anyone.",Positive
I was referred to this shop by the Nissan dealership I bought my car at. Everyone was so knowledgeable and professional. They took care of all my insurance issues. I had 2 cars in there for repairs at the same time . They did an amazing job on both cars!!!! I was more than pleased with every aspect of my experience. I will recommend this company to all my friends and family and I will never bring my car anywhere but here in the future.,Positive
"I visited ACS for the first time today. A dealer could not make a repair and only offered a replacement part. As soon as I walked in to this business I was greeted by the owner, Addison. He checked the vehicle and within a few minuted tole me that the repair could be done and he could do it while I waited. The job was finished within an hour and the repair saved me a considerable amount over the replacement. The work was of the highest quality and Addison made me feel as if I was his best customer. Anyone who thinks that exceptional customer service is a thing of the past only needs to work with Addison and ACS. He brings customer service to the highest level. Rich C/.",Positive
"I had my vehicle brought here from around the corner when I was cut-off by another driver and my front end was damaged. Addison was great in explaining his process, the time frame that my car would be in the shop and I left feeling like I was in good hands. When my car was ready it looked brand new and was carefully cleaned inside and out. Top notch work! I'm certainly going to refer others when they need help with repairs.",Positive
I had an unfortunate incident several weeks ago where a Gravel Truck spray my new Nissan Altima with Gravel while passing me on the freeway. It chip my paint up real bad plus my windshield. I took my car to ACS (Automotive Collision Services) for estimate. Addison Gamo the General Manager completed my estimate and was very professional. He had my estimate with pictures completed and emailed to the insurance company in less than 30 minutes. The insurance gave approval the next day. I took my car back in to have them complete the repairs. ACS had my car ready for me 6 days later in less time than I was told. The car was beautiful and they detailed it inside and out. I could not be more happy and satisfied. Addison treated me more like a friend than a customer great shop and great people.,Positive
"Outstanding Customer Service!!!! Addison and his team did everything they could to get my car up and running asap! Had a nasty collision and of course the insurance company wanted to do ""good enough"" repairs. Pulled my car from that shop and brought it here. They got the insurance company to pay out what they should have initially and now my car looks brand new! I will definitely be a life long customer and recommend this shop to everyone who needs any type of work done on their vehicles. You will NOT be disappointed with the work these guys too. I also had them quote some other work that was not accident related and I was shocked by how inexpensive the repair was compared to every mechanic I have ever been to. AMAZING company. Good to know there are Honest and Quality shops out there.",Positive
"I've been in here twice and have nothing but great things to say, each time I had been helped right away and was in and out quickly. The first time a piece fell off underneath my car, they took care of it free of charge. About a week later I ran over a parking curb and another piece fell off, they quickly fixed it for me and I was on my way. The owner also makes the experience here that much better, he truly cares about his customers and puts in a great effort to make sure they have their needs met. Will definitely be back here in the future!",Positive
"I heard of ACS through a family member of mine and I will never choose a different collision service from hear on out. They are affordable and truly care about your cars health. Very nice and inviting people who just want to lend a helping hand. I had major problems with my power steering, A/C, as well as radiator. Instead of spending a fortune to diagnose and replace parts that were not needed to be replaced they only had to replace my radiator cap and fill some of the levels in my car. She works good as new now and I still have $$ in the bank!",Positive
"Great Quality. Friendly People, and Fair Pricing. This happened to be the very first time that I actually enjoyed my experience with a body shop. The day of the accident I took my Mercedes in with a bent fender, busted light, and some bumper damage and Addison (the general manager) worked with me presenting different estimates and options. Extremely fair and up front with all the costs I never had to haggle but still gave me a discount wherever he could which I greatly appreciated. All in all I saved over $700 versus going somewhere like a Penske Automotive, and honestly got better quality from ACS. On the day I picked the car up, Addison personally introduced me to the people who worked on the car who were extremely friendly, professional, and talented. I cannot recommend this place enough, they go far far over and above what any normal person would expect.",Positive
I rushed in for a wiper blade during my lunch hour and was promptly helped by JD (I think). He was a joy to talk to and found my wiper blade in an instant and installed it in like 30 seconds! Will be back!,Positive
"I've never had a good experience here. Aside from a very few exceptions, the staff is consistently awful. After my last experience, I'm done. I came in around 6:30 or 7:00. A manager was on the floor and asked if I needed help with anything. There were two or three customers in line, and I was in no hurry, so I declined the help and browsed for approx ten minutes. When the line cleared, I asked the employee at the register to look up the size of my headlight bulb. The employee said nothing, he just walked over to the headlights, picked the most expensive option, immediately walked back to the register and rang it up. The first thing this employee said to me was ""cash or card?"" I said, ""I really just wanted the size. There are other, less expensive bulbs. I'm going to look at them."" The employee groaned and said, ""Whatever you want. It's not standard. It's not going to look right."" The employee was clearly angry that I wanted to look at their selection, despite not having even looked at my car. Now I don't need my hand held buying auto parts, but this is just unnecessary. First, I didn't ask for him to ring me up. I asked for the size of my headlight bulb. No need to be so frustrated or rude. It was 7:00pm--3 hours until close. I wasn't keeping anyone from leaving, and I was only in the store a grand total of twenty minutes (the place was empty by the time he got to me). Second, don't try to force me to buy a more expensive part. What kind of service is that? I get better customer service at fast food restaurants and the DMV. Third, the manager watched all of this happen and did nothing. I've worked service jobs all my life, and I try to keep in mind that you never know what someone is going through. Maybe this guy was dealing with struggles I don't understand. If that's the case, maybe he should look into working in a non-service position with the company. You can't get angry at customers for wanting to actually look at Autozone's products before making a purchase. From now on I'll go out of my way to visit another store. This has been the same service I've always received here, and management doesn't care. Don't even think about asking for help with installing anything unless you've got a few hours to spare waiting (which is a whole other, longer, more boring story). Sorry Autozone, but after years of consistently awful service at this location (not just mediocre, but actively rude and unhelpful), you've lost my business for good.",Negative
Awesome service from Scotty tonight. Came in with a belt from a whole house fan and he was able to match it right up. Very polite and will definitely go back.,Positive
"Went in to get a new windshield wiper blade and was OVERWHELMED by the number of options. One of the AutoZone associates saw me struggling and came over to help me pick the right blade. He didn't upsell me and really took the time to talk through why he was recommending the one I ended up with. Afterwards he offered to put the blade on for me. That's right, he offered without me even having to ask. Excellent and prompt customer service. What a breath of fresh air!",Positive
"Worst customer service experience. Attempted to return $50 part purchased from different Auto Zone in town. First clerk informed me the manager does not like to return parts from other stores. Eventually, the manager had to handle my return. After a few minutes told me I could not return part because my name was not listed under account. Informed me my wife would have to make return. By far the worst retail experience I've had.",Negative
I will say they are very friendly here. And helpful! Anytime I come here I am always greeted immediately. They never mind checking my engine light and suggesting what I can do. Also they have educated me on checking the basics on my car. They are just so nice here I have no complaints.,Positive
"Ok, it's an autozone... but seriously this one was pretty good for the service. As soon as we walked in we were greeted, and there was a guy in the back willing to help us as soon as he saw that bewildered look on my, ""I don't know what the heck I'm doing"" face. He walked over and told the me benefits of each product and the ones that were crap, and not to use. He was patient despite the line forming to ask him for help, and he assisted everyone he could quickly. Wait time at the register was also quick and the lady working was funny and super pleasant even though a customer had just given her a hard time. I would come back for all my ""I don't know what this thing a ma bob for my car does..."" moments. :)",Positive
I have never met a company that was so good at what they do. I've had to deal with the BMW dealership for years but I'm so glad to have found these guys. Best experience ever. Great job I will send everyone I know to you. Thank you thank you thank you,Positive
I have not got anywhere since I bought my car in 2010. These guys know their stuff in and out. Brad is great to work with and knows details on the BMW.,Positive
Nate and his crew always treat you fair and work really hard to finish their work ahead of time. Wish the serviced all makes and models!,Positive
"These guys are honest. I've been here two times and they've been straight forward. They priced pretty competively as I've shopped around before committing to my first repair. This company gained more of my respect as they don't sit around trying to pull scare tactics on you. In other words, you don't have to worry about going in to get your brakes changed and then worry about them coming back with 5 other different issues. They will make suggestions though and leave the decision up to you. Brad and his team are first class. Thanks for everything guys!",Positive
"Kameron and crew always take great care of me and my Car. Honest, reliable service done on quote and on time each time. All my questions are answered and you really feel a part of the process with the thorough explanation of the problem. They are always first to point out any unnecessary parts or services not needed to save you when they can. I always recommend them to anyone with a BMW or Mini!",Positive
"I just took two of my BMWs to Babbit Motor Werks for the first time, and it was a really great experience. The level of communication between the shop and the customer, even before you bring in your car, is like nothing that I have experienced before. You actually feel as though you are involved in the service process, as opposed to being a victim of your own automobile's problem. When you hear the prices, you don't feel as though you probably should have just traded in the car. People always say, ""I wish I had a place that I trust to service my cars."" I feel that way now after my first experience with Babbitt Motor Werks.",Positive
Always great service and reasonable prices. Babbitt has serviced our two BMWs for 5 years and never had to take them back twice. Been very honest and upfront.,Positive
"I've been taking my E46 M3 to the Babbit Tempe location since 2014. Jen is extremely attentive and quick to respond to email questions or appointment scheduling. Kameron and the rest of the techs are knowledgeable, extremely flexible in fitting me in on short notice, always take exceptional care of my car and do so at reasonable prices. I wouldn't take my M anywhere else.",Positive
"The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about all things BMW. Prices are very competitive, and they get services completed quickly so you are on your way.",Positive
Convertible top was broken on my BMW Z4. hydraulic pump had to be replaced. Price was very reasonable and less than half of amount quoted at dealership. Considering that I needed my car back ASAP as I was driving out of town the following week they did a great job. Brad is very knowledgeable and provided exceptional customer service.,Positive
"These guys are the only source for your BMW, very honest ppl and fully knowledgable of Beemer world, thanks Babbitt team",Positive
"I love Babbitt Motor Werks, I have been a client of theirs for over 10 years. Nate always gives me more that I ask for in making sure that my car is performing well. Once, he even came out to the shopping center I was broken down at and gave me a jump, and then finished up with replacing the battery! Jenn runs a tight ship and I get top notch service from them! I would highly recommend!",Positive
"New to town, did a very nice job on our x3 oil leak, fair, fast, and very friendly. Highly recommend. Don't see this type of service often ! Thanks, Rich and Sandy",Positive
"The absolute best experience my family has ever had with a mechanical shop! We have had BMW's for the past 10 years and after a first and last terrible experience with the dealer we got lucky enough to find Babbit. Usually price and quality dictate my choice in auto repair but I can honestly say that Babbit's customer service makes it all worth it. No matter whom you speak to you can be assured to get a friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly honest answer. Just got a brake flush today at which time they changed my wife's brake light for free, topped her oil for free and finished the job all in 20 minutes! I always get a second quote on any and all service on our vehicles because I'm CHEAP but Babbit never is beat on price. Frankly they are never beat on any facet of business. BMW certified mechanics and a family business that keeps us coming back! Thanks Babbit",Positive
"Just had another superb experience with Babbitt Motor Werks! I want to commend Cameron on his outstanding customer service. Technician Zac deserves the same praise for his excellent work. My 328i had a leak that was caused by a windshield installer, Zac caught this, he also did a great job installing the new blower motor that was shorted out as a result of this leak. Cameron is always great at giving good advice. He was instrumental in assisting me with the warranty issues related to the company that had improperly installed my windshield. Thanks guys, keep up the good work! I will definitely be back when next service is due, wouldn't use anyone else!",Positive
Had my car serviced today They fixed the problem and went beyond that to make sure that the car was running good Very good people.. trustworthy They are the best.... Brad took care of me right away If I could give them 10 stars I would they deserve it..,Positive
"Been having my four BMWs serviced here during the past four years (528, X5 4.6, M3 and 330) and never had an issue with them. Nathan the owner is really nice and will help you anyway he can. Great prices all around. If you want to have Nathan the owner work on your car then head up to the Scottsdale location and his wife Jennifer will check you in. He is extremely thorough so you won't be disappointed.",Positive
"These guys are awesome, they were able to take care of my oil change with out an appointment, and hit me out of there within a few minutes and took the time to inspect my vehicle and take care of some real light bulbs, and give me an inside on future maintenance I'll be needing! They are friendly and trustworthy, GREAT QUALITY!",Positive
"went to babbits with my car for some repairs, when they came back with an estimate that was almost as high as the dealer, i asked if they offered a financing option they got very rude and said "" if you can't afford to repair your car, maybe you shouldn't own one "" i for one didn't appreciate being treated this way and would not recommend this shop to anyone",Negative
"I just had my x3 repaired and am thankful for an honest family run independent BMW shop. They are much more affordable than the stealer ship and friendly. Brad, Jen and the techs are the best. My car will always return to them for their high quality service and repair.",Positive
"Summary: If you drive a BMW you should be taking it to these folks. Period. ""People giving 5 star rating to a car repair shop? Someone wake me up!!"" Is that what you are thinking? Well, these guys truly deserve it. If you drive a BMW you have probably had those mini heart attacks at the dealer when you took in your vehicle for a scheduled maintenance (or God forbid with a check engine light on) . I have been coming to these folks for about a year now and always had a pleasant experience. They explain everything, are courteous and professional and their rates are reasonable. They do not offer a loaner when you drop off the car but given the level of service they provide, I cannot and will not take away a star for that. Now, paying over $400 for a battery change is a different battle that I should be fighting with the manufacturer for. On second thought, they didn't send me an invite to come buy their vehicle. Now, did they? :)",Positive
"I took my E36 to Babbit to replace my water pump, and these guys are amazing. Very knowledgeable and professional. I was grateful that they worked to fit me into their schedule on such short notice because I had to drive to California the next day! They had no problem fulfilling some special requests I had including the type of part I wanted, and I consider it a plus that they only use genuine BMW parts. Hey, they even wash your car when they are done.",Positive
"I have had both routine maintenance and unexpected repair at Babbitt a total of 3 times, and, I am a big fan. The prices are better than Chapman and the service is extremely fast. It can be tough to swallow the cost of bmw repair, but Babbitt has a good shop. I was happy to find out that the parts and service come with a 2 year warranty too. As a side note - the guy at the front desk has a fun attitude and has looked out for me.",Positive
"Have been taking my 2002 Mini Cooper to Babbitt's for a couple of years now. They have always provided excellent service. Prices are fair and they never do work or charge me for something I don't need. Had my car in there today and Brad took care of me. Great customer service. Highly recommend them. Used to always take my car to the Mini dealer but after going to Babbitt's for a second opinion about an expensive repair, they checked out my problem and fixed it. The dealer's diagnosis was wrong and was literally 20 times more expensive that what I paid Babbitt's.",Positive
"When it comes to cars, especially foreign cars, it's nearly impossible to find someone you can trust. I've been to two of the three locations in town and every time I'm treated with respect and honesty. Owning a BMW is an expensive choice once your warranty runs out, so having a shop like this is comforting. I won't EVER take my car back to the local dealership for that reason. Great job fellas, keep up the good work!!",Positive
"These guys always take care of my 2002 E46 with 190k. Brad is friendly and let's you know details of any problems they find vs the dealership just throw numbers at you. I have been going here for 4 years and recommend them to all BMW owners. This last time I went there for brakes and they told me all the wear on both front and back and did not try to sell me on 4 brakes when only 2 were needed. Miles I did notice this last time that my antifreeze or washer fluid was not topped up, but I specifically didn't ask for it so maybe that is the reason. Great job guys Paul B Tara D",Positive
"They are Excellent! Being a Single woman, I have been ripped off many times from other Car repairs- These guys are awesome and very fast! They will have your repair done very quikly and it will be done right. Nathan- ""The Owner"" even helped me get my money back from another car place that ripped me off. I am very thankful for your help and Honesty- Keep up the Good work! -Julie",Positive
"Had been going here for a while but not any more. Left car overnight because it was not starting properly. Didn't hear back from them in the morning even after leaving a message. When I finally got through they seemed uninterested in hearing my description of the problem. Wasn't until late in the afternoon that I heard back--they found no faults on the computer so that was that. I started asking some questions, hoping to get ideas about this potentially very serious problem. Got attitude and annoyance in response. Also realized that the car had missed some maintenance even though it had just been in twice recently. I don't have confidence in them anymore.",Negative

"Purchased a vehicle from the lot. And it's been less than 30 days and I've had it in the shop three times already. The lights that were on the dash when It was purchased and we're guaranteed to be removed are back on .literally 24 hours later the lights are right back on every time. I don't even know how they got it through admissions besides just enabling and disconnecting the sensors. Personally had to coach checked on the same time and every time it's thrown the same codes.This was my son's very first major purchase. He just turned 18 and bought this vehicle. And it's unfortunate that lots like this don't Rectify issues as indicated. Buyer be careful while they have a fantastic first time buyers program you get what you paid. Jesse the technician in the service department repeatedly gives us the runaround. The service manager never calls back and the finance lady Shakira or Shinarmar has the worst attitude ever. In fact after numerous text messages indicating that she did not receive the down payment in which she did and instead of researching it and coming back to issue after readearching it in a respectful manner she negated and argued it for over 30 minutes and continue to send Confrontational text messages and reverted to calling personally and threatening -all of which was recorded. When asked to no longer text she then threatened to repossess the vehicle because we wanted to opt out of receiving text messages? Yet we provided an alternate phone number for her to contact . completely unacceptable a unfortunate. Bob our sales agent was incredible on the initial visit but this had turned into something absolutely ridiculous based on issues with the vehicle they sold and their accounting corporate office, payment clerk being and the inability to audit Accra correctly. # behumble.",Negative
"$6000 down for a car that is an auctioned POS? Bro... you guys are absolutely garbage of a dealership, they are complete criminals. Stay away as far as possible, and if the manger tries to be a hard ass go in person to confront him, he backs down real quick I promise fuck you big 3 no one is going to buy your shit cars. Never again. Stay far away!!",Negative
"I am not one to leave bad reviews. Save yourself the headache, run away fast from Big 3 this place is an embarrassment to car dealerships. Jason (Manager) absolute criminal, ripping good people off. I went in took the time to make the deal just to get a piece of crap vehicle that was completely unsafe. As a former mechanic & auto performance shop owner. I was totally lied to about their ASE mechanic looking over car prior to purchase. On the ride home I could tell car had prior major issues & dangerous front/rear suspension issues. Got vehicle on Saturday afternoon drove home & parked it. I returned vehicle Monday morning as they were closed Sunday. Then their mechanic told me that I needed wait 4 days before they could look at it. I then said I wanted to return vehicle, which they said they would exchange for another. The other car (2008 Maxima) was $9,995 which had a sign on it, but then added an additional $4000 to make it $13,995 & tried to sell it to me for that price. Told them to take their cars & shove it. Big 3 then put on my credit the car was repossessed. Which was a Complete LIE car was never repossessed. They refused to return my down payment of $1200 & then when I sent them the Small Claims Court notice this criminal dealership ignored it. BUYER BEWARE unless you like getting screwed over. **Update** 3-9-17 These criminals of a Car Dealership just keep getting worse. Some how they weaseled their way to add a BS $2313 to the balance. 10-08-16 Crap car returned within 24hrs. 2-20-16 Jason called me trying to be a hard ass, then told me to quit being a little girl & make payment arrangements. As a business owner of 16yrs myself this moron would be FIRED. I guess the owners at Big 3 AutoMart allow employees to act like jackasses & rip people off. They claim they closed account 11-17-16, On 3-9-17 added $2,3114 to the balance of car. TOTAL LIARS",Negative
"I recently purchased a car from Big 3 Automart in Chandler and I LOVE it so far. I got my vehicle at a great price and Bob helped me out with purchasing it. The whole process was easy thanks to him. Great guy, great company. I am referring EVERYONE to Big 3 Automart if they're in the market for a new, used car. Ask for Bob!",Positive
Bad business They buy auction cars...resell for a premium... Hide behind as is polices Beware!!! Shady business practices Stay away from any dealer that advertises TAX Return as down payment!!! They are not Animal friendly If you do buy a vehicle make sure it has a proper extended warranty,Negative
"Big 3 was able to finance me in my dream car dispite my having limited credit. Thank you Big 3, for helping when other dealers could not! I have a great car and a deal on financing!",Positive
"There are a few times in life when people are glad they didn't get a car. I was one of those people today. I came to Automart with very bad circumstances, bad credit, upside down in current car, etc. I spoke with Bob, who was incredibly helpful and kind, and didn't make me feel discouraged or irresponsible. He was very honest about my circumstances and wanted to help me in anyway possible. There were some options that were available to me, but suggested I go to a different place that had more options for cars within my price range, and something that I would be happy with, as I would need to be driving a car that was significantly decreased in value than what I am driving now. It meant the world to me that he really had my best interest at heart and wasn't a typical salesman. I would recommend them to anyone!",Positive
"If there is an option for zero stars that's what I'd leave. TERRIBLE place to shop for a car....unless of course it's only a partial car you're seeking. Way to go big 3 on covering all safety measures when selling ""vehicles"" I have NEVER been allowed to test drive a car without not only seatbelts that don't work but HOW ABOUT THE TURN SIGNALS ASSHOLES????!! If you buy a car from this place be sure and ask for Bob. Bob will give you the best service in screw the customer standards possible there's no doubt there. And make sure you bring a towel for the cleanup after your soul has been butt f$@& repeatedly!",Negative
Awesome little car dealership. We got a great deal and everyone was very nice and accommodating. We had an issue with the AC about a week after we purchased the vehicle and they fixed it free of charge with no issues. Ask for Bob!,Positive
"Glen is ok, but Management does not honor agreements made...They put you off and come up with excuses and stall...very much a typical used car dealer that is out for the quick buck and not customer service",Negative
"Purchased a car there almost 2 years ago and it is still going strong. Initially, the transmission went out shortly after purchasing it. However, it was my error since when I purchased the car the ""AT"" light was on which I thought meant that the car was in Automatic mode instead of the tiptronic manual. When I called Big3, they told me that I could bring the car back and exchange ti for a different one or get a full refund. Instead, I opted to use the ASC aftermarket warranty that I purchased from them. The warranty covered a full transmission replacement from a Mazda dealership. But I could've chosen any certified mechanic to do the work. But, most importantly, Big 3 had excellent customer service, an awesome selection of cars and fair prices.",Positive
"As soon as I pulled in, they attended to my bike and I was out of there in short time. You know you're dealing with the right place when the person who works on your bike is the same person who meets you at the cashier's desk - no middle guy, reasonable pricing, great work!",Positive
"Great short-notice HD repair on my road king!! New to area and appreciated their service and quality. Very honest and passionate, would recommend highly-thanks.",Positive
"This is the worst place to take your bike. I went in and they put my oil filter in wrong. No oil got to the top end and the bike ceased up on my way home. I put my bike on the trailer take it back to them, Shawn denied it was anything they did so I took them to court. I had business with my car at the business across the street and the little mechanic saw me got on his bike chased me down bell rd. cut me off, flipped me off and told me he knew where I lived. Like his business he was all talk, when I stopped. Beware of these guys, go with the rookie MMI grad first.",Negative
Sean what can I say! Always takes care of my hubby's Harley. From tires to advice Sean always comes thru. The services and prices are great too.,Positive
"I took my bike here to get my fork seals replaced, carb cleaned, and because it was there an oil change. First, they did replace my fork seals, but didn't didn't put any oil back into the forks!!! How stupid can you be to forget that! On top of that the bolts on the top of the of the forks are chipped and rounded. Then they didn't even clean my carb! They stripped the screws to the carb cover, but the carb bowl was all tarred up. I had to take it apart in the middle of a motorcycle trip because the bike wouldn't run without having the choke fully out. Next the oil filter was linking because tweedle dee and tweedle dumb ass forgot to tighten down the oil filter. Lastly, I have massive paints chips and dings in my fenders from when they were probably from when they were trying to learn how to use a wrench on my bikes forks. When I called them out on this they said all that shit was my fault and it was there before. SO, long story short DO NOT take your bike here!",Negative
I have been going to Bikers Bay for years. I just replaced my Intruder with my first Harley. Sean was a lot of help to me and explaining what to look for and things I should do as I am riding. He is going to be doing some custom work for me. I will continue to bring my bike for any service,Positive
"I have been going there for years now. They are absolutely the best. I ride 25-30 miles one way just to get there, because I trust their work and most of all their prices. Over the years I have had more than just oil changes and would highly recommend them! They had a mesa location which was closer to me, but they closed it a few years ago.",Positive
"Took the BMW K1200LT in for new rear tire and shaft drive fluid flush before a 1000 mile round trip ride to Albuquerque, They got everything done right in time for me to pick it up the day before. Front brake felt grabby so they adjusted it no charge. Dropped off the ZRX1100 with a few leaks and some carb issues. Won't ever take my bikes anywhere else.",Positive
"Bikers Bay Is number one In my world. I'm a Women Rider Victory Magnum. I'm always treated with respect by the service men that work there. I always go to them for Oil Changes and I am VERY PLEASED with the service and prices and their knowledge of working on my bike. Thank you, Bikers Bay ;) From Mary",Positive
I have driven and ridden past this shop for years but never thought service would be this fast or easy. No appointment needed for an oil change and I was in and out in 30 minutes. All staff were friendly and knowledgeable. They were truly bike enthusiasts and knowledgeable. They will be getting all my future business.,Positive
"I had a few minutes to kill and since I just left Biker's Bay thought I would write a review. I have been bringing my motorcycles to Biker's Bay for about 8 years and their service has been consistent with doing the repairs right the first time, priced fairly and professional demeanor. I highly recommend Biker's Bay!",Positive
"I have been using Bikers Bay for the last 3 years. If you're looking for a shop with good prices and great service, this is it! What I like most is they won't try to sale you stuff you don't need and you can talk directly to the guys that are working on your bike. I highly recommend this shop.",Positive
"VERY UPSET! I have issues with my bike (1987 Ninja) and needed an estimate. The manager Shawn told me to drop the bike off after telling him it was a 1987 Ninja several times to see what the problem is and take care of it for me. The bike broke down on the way. So I had a local shop ""attempt"" to fix it. They screwed me over $200 and the bike is still not running right. I talked to Bikers Bay again today, just to have a rude guy tell me the manager Shawn will not work on a bike that is older than 1990. I went over my bad experience with the other local shop and my situation again. He said he could NOT help me. I also waiting on hold to talk to Shawn since he is the person who told me to bring him the bike int he first place. Nobody answered! Very upset and will NOT recommend this place. I am out $200, still do not have a running bike and nobody seems to help me! UGH!",Negative
"I've been here before a few years ago for tires, when it had a previous owner. This time, I called ahead to be sure that the tire I needed was in stock. I was told yes, come on over. I rode 1/2 hour in the Phoenix summer heat and was told by the person that told me the tire I needed was there, that he actually did not have that tire. Ask if I was angry... Yes I was! He obviously never looked for the tire and was giving me lip service. I will not return and suggest you don't either.",Negative
Guy answering phone didn't waste anytime telling me my bike was junk and they don't like messing with jap bikes. Never got a chance to try their services but dude was a prick.,Negative
"I have never been disappointed with the Bikers Bay guy's and they even work on metrics. Their pricing is reasonable and they do good work without trying to up-sell services. Not like North Valley Motorsports on Cave Creek Rd., I brought them a tire and rim and they charged me $150+ to change out the tire and bearings. They used stick on weights that will come off in the 1st rain but I didn't care about that because I use dyna-beads anyway. Before I removed their weights I checked the balance and they were way off, low quality and highway robbery, I only went there because I had a $25 gift card from them to use up. Burn me once shame on them, burn me twice shame on me. BTW, last time my wife got tires at Bikers Bay they did it for $60 less than North Valley quoted and they also did it the quality way, with clip-on weights.",Positive
"Bikers Bay is THE place to go. I needed a tail light kit installed which seemed basic at first, but turned out my bike had an entire different system installed (I had purchased second hand). Derek effortlessly started on my bike and diligently took care of the assembly. Location is super convenient on Bell Rd, and the staff is superb. Not only is the quality of work top-notch, but they are a cool bunch of dudes as well. They are really knowledgeable about bikes, and are looking out for the safety of their customers. Highly recommend Bikers Bay! Needless to say, I will return here to have all service done on my bike.",Positive
"Bikers Bay looks out for your safety, and watches your wallet. You never feel gouged. Shawn and Derek are great mechanics on all bikes. I needed a part that they found and picked up, and still had me out in a fraction of the time a dealer takes!! They even remained open after hours to finish my bike!! Thank you, Biker's Bay!!",Positive
"Well there I was, hummin' along with my vintage '81 Gold Wing pinning for floor boards. ""They look so comfortable on other bikes... why can't I?"" The problem with vintage is most parts are discontinued and forget optional parts. Well once again the great folks at Biker's Bay Phoenix came to my rescue. They hooked me up with a guy who can find ANYTHING... literally! I tried to install these new on the shelf (NOS) floor boards but things didn't quite line up exactly as expected (common for vintage Gold Wing optional parts). I took my boards & went to see if there was something that could be done. No sooner did I arrive that Shawn put my baby up & had those boards installed with some needed fabrication. I know he worked on it for close to 2 hours but only charged me a 1/2 hour labor! You don't get that kind of service ANYWHERE! Now I'm hummin' along with my floor boards... and yes, they are more comfortable than pegs. Thanks guys.",Positive
"i first visited biker's bay on bell in north phoenix in 2007 with my 2002 honda vtx1800c. i had custom signals, ""lazer"" brand, mounted under the rear fender from the sawed-off remainder of the stock setup. over the years, the metal proved to be too weak to hold a small ""bullet-sized"" signal and on a few occasions the metal would break and the sig would get hammered by the wheel and the road. one day cruising down lincoln it happened again and i said ""fuck this, i'm drilling these puppies into the fender."" after a few phone calls to competitors and hearing about their prices, i ended up at biker's bay. i had a new signal ordered from exile and i asked them to just drill them into the fender and i pointed to where i wanted them placed. a day later, it was done. the lights were aligned, and i rode thousands of miles without an issue. the price was more than reasonable and the customer service was more than personable. my buddy mike, who posted below, went there after i told him how great they are. i had other times i visited biker's bay. i bought a snazzy bag/purse for my woman that was hand made by a female employee, tony. i had brake issues and brought it to them for two days as i sat in a bar across the street. they repaired the problem, caused by the work done at a local honda shop, and didn't charge me hundreds of bucks. after multiple hours over the course of many days, it was 100 bucks. i cannot say that you will get those prices, because you might be a douche, but the work they do, and the people who do it, are smart, kind, knowledgeable, and i would recommend biker's bay in north phx to anyone. any time. whatever you ride.",Positive
"This place is great.. I have just about all of the service on my V-rod done here. Their prices are very reasonable and turn around is very quick. Expect it to cost half as much and take half as long as a dealership. They service metrics and domestic bikes, and I have ever seen them look down on any two wheeler brought in. A friend of mine who was having his moto serviced here was without a way to come get the bike when it was done.. They came and picked him up at his house! Another repair was quoted at $1200 at a honda dealer, but Bikers Bay found they had overstated the issues and inflated the cost 4x. BB has him riding again for only $300. My hog needed a new o-ring, and when the non HD one leaked, they went and got the HD part, topped off the oil, and had me out in 30 minutes, no charge. Face it, AZ is stock full of guys fresh out of MMI. The same guys that are working at a dealership are the same guys you'll find here.",Positive
Bill is incredible! He responded to our call immediately and set up an appointment. His shop is wonderful. Spotlessly clean. His customer service is stellar and the quality of his work is fantastic. Thank you so much Bill!,Positive
"Once again, Bill exceeded expectations tinting my new Ford Flex just a few days ago. He has tinted all my cars and home windows. I very highly recommend Bill's Custom Window Tinting. Also - he is the man to see about getting your auto windshield / windows properly replaced with quality glass.",Positive
"This was one of the best experiences that I have ever had, hands down. I had a professional tint job done over 7 years ago and one window had a couple small bubbles in the corner. He removed the old tint and re did it, in a fast, professional manner and it looks great! I would recommend him to anyone, regardless of what type of vehicle. Bill rocks!",Positive
This review is a year and half in the making. Had Bill tint my 2013 Corolla and very happy to say he did an outstanding job. No bubbles after all this time. The tint is still in great shape. He did it all for a good price too! I highly recommend him! Thank you Bill!,Positive
"Very professional, organized and punctual! His garage is so meticulously organized and clean. He did a great job and also explained the process and the after care in detail. He has wifi and I also took a call from work in the customer area. Price is very comparable to the others, actually even better. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",Positive
"After checking all the 5 star window tinting place on Yelp I decided to go to Bill because he's close. He's not replying as quick as other places on Yelp. But I called him on Tuesday and set up an appointment for the next day easily. On Wednesday I brought my car to Bill. He went through all the options and I chose the CXP film as he advised. He did a pretty good job and he was quick. Winthin 2 hours I was all set. He put tapes on my power window button to remind me not to roll down the window in 2 days. 3 days later, I double checked his work. I rolled down all the windows and rolled up, wiped all the tint he put on, everything looks good, and I can hardly see a bubble. Price is reasonable, it's less than half of I would spend at Mercedes Dealer for similar film. So, I'm satisfied. Good job Bill and I've recommended my friend to come as well.",Positive
"Fast, courteous service at an in-expensive cost. I went with the dye material and it was the lease expensive installation in town.",Positive
"Bill said it would take two hours and delivered as promised. Friendly, knowledgeable, very clean shop to wait in and I would definitely recommend him to anyone. Great job for a great price.",Positive
"Bill tinted my wife's 2004 Corolla a few years back, and he did a wonderful job at a very good price. Bill is extremely friendly, professional and detail-oriented - and his expertise shows. The windows still look great, and I would recommend his work to anyone.",Positive
Bill is as good as it gets. Very professional and incredibly knowledgeable. He made specific recommendations regarding the various films to consider installing on my vehicle windows. He explained the benefits and drawbacks of each one and let me choose. What I appreciate most is how detail oriented he is. My window tint was cut and installed with absolute precision. I will definitely give Bill all my business moving forward and I've already recommended him to three people.,Positive
"I'd been wanting to get my Honda Accord windows tinted for a long while. This week I had the time to have it done, so I called Bill to ask him a few questions. He answered the phone promptly, and helped me understand more about the entire process and what kind of film would be best for my needs. I found his price quote really fair, and made an appointment for the following day. I waited in the customer area while Bill worked on my car. He's polite, friendly, very professional and extremely competent. Bill has done this for twenty years, and knows his business inside out. Not only now I'm happy with the fresher look my car has, but I'm also bothered a lot less by direct sunshine while I drive. And all this for a reasonable price. I should have had those windows tinted months ago!",Positive
"I am Extremely satisfied with the job Bill did on my MKS! Three weeks later and the windows look great. If you have any doubts about using Bill for your tinting needs, they will go away when you see his shop. He is obviously a professional and his work reflects this. The service was quick and the price fair. I would not hesitate to use Bill again for any tinting needs. Tim, Gilbert AZ",Positive
"Courteous and skillful. Great service. Used Bill for a car tint, but have also had colleagues use him for commercial tinting. They were very pleased. Will definitely use him again. Also love the lifetime warranty.",Positive
"So glad I went with Bill and not someone doing the work in my own dusty garage. Bill has an excellent facility grafted right onto his house, once inside you'd never know you weren't inside a ""real"" business location. He's a consummate pro and it shows, in facility, chosen materials, and results. Got a fair, competitive price and a perfect tint job, while I waited and got some work done in his comfortable wifi-equipped waiting area. In and out in under 3 hours. I highly recommend Bill for your automotive or home/business tinting needs, and I'll definitely be a repeat customer next time I have the need.",Positive
"I used this business to have the windows on my car tinted. Even though the business was run out of garage attached to a residence, the garage was very clean and showcased the different types of tint for both car and home. The service I received was very friendly, honest, and efficient. I was happy with the end result, the amount of time to tint the windows, scheduling an appointment, and the cost. I would recommend this business to family and friends, and will use again should the need arise.",Positive
"Yesterday, I went to see Bill for tinting on my four side and back windows. He owns the business and has a really cool tint shop attached to his house. There's a small lounge area that you can wait in and free water in the fridge. We were there for two and a half hours which is way less time than other places. I had been quoted four hours by another business in the Valley for the same work. Bill is very professional and is very detail oriented. He will work inch by inch on your windows to make sure that they are perfect. On the back window..he did the cut for the tint so you could see my rear window third brake light. Absolutely genius! That just shows how much he cares about perfection. I took the car out of the shop and have had it for almost 24 hours. It looks amazing and have seen no bubbles pop up yet. Even though this is normal if it does. Bill makes sure you leave happy, is super inexpensive, don't ever get tinting done at dealer, and gives you care information so the tint will last for a long time. Good shop and service!!",Positive
"Got my new car tinted there yesterday and it was like walking into a buddy's garage. Bill was great and had my car done on time and right at the price he gave me over the phone with no pressure upsale or anything. The job looks great, although its still ""curing"". I just sat and watched basketball while he did all the work. Nice to give my money to a local business as well. Would recommend and will be my only place to get tint done from now on.",Positive
"Just got my car tinted at Bill's 1 month ago. Went really well. Excellent service and results. Made an appointment on Sat and car was done on time as promised. After the typical dry up period, did not see mistake anywhere.",Positive
"Not sure if it is common but Bill was able to tint my truck on only a couple hours notice. Very fast, friendly and it looks great. Very highly recommended.",Positive
"Love the tint job! Bill was very accommodating with our schedule, timely in getting the job done and most importantly, put a really nice tint on the windows. Looks great and would highly recommend. Bill was a pleasure to work with!",Positive
"Bill worked with my busy schedule and got my windows tinted and full clear bra applied on my new 2015 BMW M3. He did an amazing job and went above and beyond to get me the best product. Bill was extremely attentive and answered all my questions, and his attention to detail on the work he did was amazing. The tint looks amazing and the clear bra can be barely seen. I had some custom work done on the front end and Bill was able to still work around it and customize the clear bra to fit perfectly.",Positive
"Cool dude, great work, at a competitive price. Bill tented my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee a few weeks ago. I couldn't be happier with the job. And I was in and out in a few hours.",Positive
"Bill set me up with a nice window tint on my 2010 Dodge 2500. (I'll post pictures as soon as I get some uploaded). Waited for the 30 day period to see how everything looked before I wrote a post on here. My opinion: excellent job. Tint looks great. Bill had multiple options, but wasn't pushy on the most expensive materials he had in stock as everything was high quality, I eventually led my self to the top line he had for tint. His facilities at his house are pretty much the coolest garage a man can have. Great place to wait while he works on the vehicle. If your looking for a long term tint that looks really nice, go with him, well worth the extra money.",Positive
"I've been using Bill for the past 10 years for my commercial and personal vehicles, he even tinted the windows on my old house. Bill is a perfectionist in his work. I once had an issue with a piece of tint a few years after Bill had installed it and he re-tinted the window at no charge(defect in tint). I would highly recommend Bill at Bill's Custom. Stay away from cheap $199 dealer installers--If you plan on keeping the vehicle for any amount of time and support local business owners!!! Just my two cents.",Positive
"Bill has tinted several vehicles for me and my wife and today he just finished my wifes 350Z, which he not only tinted but also added clear bra and it turned out terrific. In the past other than our cars, he has also tinted the windows in our entire home which has made a world of difference in our A/C bills. Bill is by far the most reasonable in his prices than anyone I have come across and not only that you can leave his place of business feeling that you have made a friend. Thanks Bill !",Positive
"Thank you Bill!! Last year my boyfriend had him tint his new Jetta and we both were completely satisfied. When I recently got a 2013 Beetle Turbo I immediately knew where to make an appointment. 2 hours was all it took, literally down to the minute and I am set for the summer! He went over all of my choices of shades, it is a very clean garage, well organized and extremely personable. I feel like I've known him for years, that is how comfortable I am. He comes highly recommended in my book!!",Positive
"Bill tinted my '07 honda odyssey and he did a wonderful job. He was friendly, nice, and very knowledgable on tinting. His prices beat out several other places as well. I recommend getting your car tinted by him.",Positive
"It so sad when you rely on a mechanic/shop to be honest and do the work. I've had to take my vehicle in 4x for the same problem, that they claim was fixed. Now they want labor cost to reevaluate. That was your job in the first place!! The problem never went away!... Stick to doing brakes and oil changes!! ....NOT RECOMMENDED!",Negative
"This is by far the best place I've ever gone for oil changes. Very friendly, professional, and timely service. They've definitely earned my business for life. Thanks!!!",Positive
"Andrew is the store manager, and runs a tight ship and he's got a great staff. I took my SUV there for a 2nd opinion after another shop quoted $750 for front brake job, Andrew's team did the job for $499 total. They were happy to apply military veteran discount as well. I recommend this shop !",Positive
I live downtown Phoenix and I will only get my car serviced at this Brake Masters location. The staff is always honest and respectful and mindful of each customers needs. I highly recommend this particular Brake Masters.,Positive
"My boyfriend and I brought both of our cars here. GREAT customer service, AFFORDABLE prices and HONEST service. They are upfront and honest that my truck didn't need brakes. My boyfriends car needed a lot of work (which we knew going into it), they had awesome prices and gave us several options. I won't go anywhere else, 5 stars is an understatement.",Positive
"I have had the worst car repair experience of my life over the last two weeks with Brake Masters Store #209 off Germann Road in Chandler. I went in to the location with a mis-fire on my Honda Accord. The manager informed me it needed a new ignition coil and new spark plugs. I was able to get the parts a little cheaper at the local Autozone but had Brake Masters install the parts. When I picked up the vehicle the issue was not resolved. The check engine light was still on and when it took it back to Autozone it was the same issue. I took my car back to Brake Masters. They said I need a valve adjustment for $360 and said they fixed the initial issue and the car was running fine. Today I had an actual reputable mechanic fix my car, it was a bad fuel injector. The issue is fixed. It is clear the technicians and managers lied about fixing the issue and wanted to milk more money out of me. I am absolutely appalled. I cannot believe the service I have been provided and lack of ownership of Brake Masters for misdiagnosing the issue. Everyone I have spoke with was condescending and argumentative. No one ever apologized or shown any level of customer service.",Negative
BEWARE!!! MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE PAYING FOR! In the time spand of a year I've taken my car into brake master twice and both times they changed my transmission fluid and charged me over 100 dollars. I later found out that transmission fluid only needs to be changed every 50-60k mikes yet they found it necessary after 2k. What they told me was a complete lie.,Negative
"I have been going here for oil changes for around 4 years. Great service, friendly employees and comfortable waiting area. No issues and no negative experiences here.",Positive
"Thank you Andrew for great service and price! I had struts replaced, oil change, alignment brakes, rotors done on 7/22/17. Very pleased there is a new manager at this location I can trust. James was very professional as well. I am no longer disappointed and can now fully endorse using this location. Thank you! Disappointed.... I pulled up, Juan(the manager) saw me but said nothing. I went in the front door and asked for the express oil change. 40 minutes later they are starting on it! Only one other customer there. Everyone looking on their phones... just lazy. Only nice part about it was when they rang me up so I could leave. Update: Andrew( manager) called me back and assures me the issues I had have been addressed. Offered free oil change on my next visit. Very much appreciated and I will be giving them another try. Thank you Andrew",Positive
"Been here a few times. Everyone I have worked with is helpful, friendly and informative. They always get me in and out quickly and I never feel like they're trying to add a bunch of stuff on to squeeze a few bucks out of me.",Positive
"I searched yelp for an honest auto mechanic shop in Chandler. The review results led me to Brake Masters. We recently bought a used car and brought it here under warranty to investigate a funny sound during startup. James, store manager and fellow veteran, patiently listened to us describe the problem. He and his team investigated and found a top end engine repair that needed to be made. They got it approved and made the repair. We got the car back and it runs great. James and his team were competent, knowledgeable, and honest. I highly recommend them.",Positive
"I brought my sons car to this BrakeMasters because I trust them completely and they are always fair and honest. I was out of there in 30 minutes and was not pushed into other services that ""they recommend"". They know how to take care of cars and people here. I I am always given 5 star treatment here! I have been to this Brake Masters with my car three times before yesterday. I was always treated with such respect and honesty. My experiences started when I came to BrakeMasters at Crossroads Center in Chandler for new brakes as was urgently recommended at the Chevy dealer I had been taking my car to for its routine maintenance. At the Chevy dealer, they wanted to replace all 4 of my tires over a year ago, replace my brakes, and wanted to charge me over $1,000 for those two services. I said I'd think about it, and left. Over 6 months later I went to this BrakeMasters, and they told me I don't need my brakes replaced yet and that I still had at least another 6 months of wear left before I'd need them replaced. They recommended I get my tires replaced soon, but if I want to come back to them in 6 months they would recheck my brakes to see if they needed to be replaced. I keep coming back to them for all of my maintenance work and always will from now on.",Positive
"This is the place to go! Today was my second experience at this BM location and I didn't think it was possible but it was better than my last! With the help of Andrew and his team, I am now worry free when driving my car and I plan to always use this location for my automotive maintenance and repairs. Thank you again guys I appreciate the no interest financing and quality customer service + work.",Positive
"WARNING DONT GO TO THIS SHOP. This is literally THE WORST car shop I have been to. (I would give negative stars but yelp doesn't allow that) I went in yesterday for a very simple total oil change. They do the oil, filter, tire rotation, top off fluids, etc. instead of the express where it's just the oil and filter. I had a stripped drain plug when they went back after the oil change, which meant I needed a new one. Totally fine. They didn't have the part, so the front desk guy went over to their closet shop to get another. Perfect, convenient, thanks for doing that for me. BUT NO. Instead of getting the right size they tried to use a size bigger, crammed it into the drain hole, and ended up cracking the entire oil pan. I found this out the next morning when I woke up to low oil and oil all over my front drive. Now, I called and told them and took it in. They inspected my car and found in fact, the tech did crack my oil pan and they would have to cover all costs to fix that and give me another oil change. Took them about an hour to figure that out. Told me it would take about 3 hours to get the pan, replace all the parts, and put in new oil. IT ACTUALLY took 5 and a half hours. No regard for the fact that they told me it would be three and I had plenty of other things to get done today. I called three times during the day and no one could tell me a real estimate, no one could tell me why it was taking so much longer. Not only was it a bad oil change and they have bad techs not paying attention, they gave me estimates for brake replacements that I absolutely do not need, and told me I was 5k miles over replacing my timing belts (not a small job) when in fact I was 5k UNDER and still had time to worry about getting it done. They were trying to hassle me out of my money and do a shotty job (because I'm a young women ""who doesn't know better""). Absolutely worst shop I have been to for what I thought was going to be an easy, 45 minute oil change. Save your time, worry, and money and DO NOT GO HERE.",Negative
"This place has always been pretty reasonable for the basic oil change. However, always trying to get you to fix things that don't really need to be messed with. Last week when I was in there the normal mgrs were not there and the ""new guy"" was cocky, rude and unprofessional. I asked where the mgr Steve was at and he said to me, ""not sure why that matters"". Okay Loser, there will be a lot of customers not returning to this location because of this guy! :/",Negative
After paying $800 plus my brakes still squeak! Went back and the guy told me it only squeaked once. I had video of it and he agreed to look at it again. I don't think they did. Now it's really squeaky.,Negative
I brought my car in earlier this week after I noticed that my brakes were grinding. It was very convenient for me to make an appt on line. I dropped my car off at noon and received a call by 12:30 with results. My brakes were repaired not long after that and I was out the door by 2. Everyone was very polite and honest with me and price was reasonable. Highly recommend Brake Masters on Germann and Gilbert Rd.,Positive
"Oh my goodness! My husband took our 2006 Dodge Charger to this location to have a regular oil change, and have all the fluids topped off. He went in at 2 and was done by 430, too long in my opinion. After the car was serviced my husband picked me up, we went home i dropped him off, and My son and I went to go get dinner. I was traveling on the 202 when my car started overheating. I thought to myself "" What in the world, i just had my car checked by the ""professionals"" Boy was i wrong. My car ended up overheating on the 202 right in the middle of rush hour. I tried doing as much as i could to get back on the road with letting it cool down and checking the water ( all the while my 7 month old son was in the back seat) finally I got a hold of my mother who has AAA and they towed me home. By this time breakmasters was already closed. I got up early the next morning and called right away. I spoke with a ""manager"" name James. I told him the situation in which he laughed at me! Thats right LAUGHED! He told me "" I highly doubt it was our fault!' I said "" My car was perfectly fine before you ""maintained"" it."" I was so upset i told him i would be contacting the BBB. To this day my car is not mobile it has just been sitting at my house. Not once did i get a ""I'm Sorry"" I would not recommend this place to anyone! Me and my husband are new parents with only one income, i would not have taken my perfectly good car to these people if i knew the repercussions.",Negative
"I took my car and my daughter's car for brakes yesterday. They did an awesome job and were very honest about what needed to be done. They stayed within the price quoted too. So I'm taking my husband's Denali in today for an oil change and brake inspection. Being a woman who doesn't know a lot about cars, I appreciate the honesty and quality with this Brake Masters.",Positive
"I decided last minute to join a friend in Vegas this weekend and since it's last minute I'm driving. My car has a slight oil leak that I needed to have checked out, but today I just time for a quick oil change. I explained my situation and they recommended an appointment and express oil change. $20 for the oil change WITHOUT A COUPON. For the price alone I'd return, but they did so much better. I had been to Brake Masters before, but never this location. David was working at the front desk. He was very polite, was working the entire time (not the case at other quick lube places), and even shook my hand. They did the job in less than the promised 30 minutes and had me out of there in time. No up sell, no pressure. I'm excited to bring my car back to fix the oil leak and I'll update review then.",Positive
NO is the simple word to this team of fools that do really shitty work. No No never again that simple. They totally screwed me. Good bye. Brakes are making soo many noises after a new brake job and they never fixed the AC either. Do NOT GO HERE!,Negative
"I always get my oil changed at this Brake Masters. As others have pointed out, no upsell, honest mechanics and a clean facility. The last time I went in for my oil change, I needed a new cabin filter and the guys even told me that it would be way cheaper to go to autozone and do it myself, then proceeded to show me where it was so I could do it when I got home. Not very common in the repair industry.",Positive
"These People are the Rudest A**holes ever. First off after Charging close to $600 worth of work, then broke my car. My Brake pedal was almost to the floor, and they told me it was my back brakes. They adjusted the back brakes and there was NO CHANGE in pedal height. They striped 4 bolts on the ""Upper Oil Pan"" (engine). They do not even stand behind they're work. I took my car to another mechanic and I was told it was the Brake Power Booster. I got it replaced CORRECTLY and now my brakes work great (not thanks to these A**HOLES!)",Negative
"HAve been to this location before for flushes, etc and had no problems. However, after failing a smog test, I drover over here bc its close by. I wanted them to check codes and let me know what was wrong. About 5 hours later, they called to tell me that my ECM (car computer) and fuel pump were bad, and that there was probably going to be even more repairs needed once they got into it. My quote for the 2 things was $1600, and anything else they found was going to be more. I went next morning, picked up my car and paid my $90 diagnosis fee. I took the car to my regular mechanic who checked everything and the only thing that was wrong with the car was a burned out check engine light bulb. Fuel pump was perfect, ECM working perfectly. He told me that there were old codes that hadn't been cleared, and once he cleared them, the CEL went off. Went back to smog station next day, and passed with no issues. So, if you need your tranny fluid changed, this place might be ok. For real engine issues, go to a real mechanic. These guys are throwing darts at the problem and charging you for it. At the very least, get a second opinion before you green light any engine repairs.",Negative
"I personally installed some new struts on my wife's HHR and needed to get it aligned afterwards. I looked online and found a coupon for $59 alignment and oil change. They deducted $15 for the oil change since it was just done. $45 alignment, good clean work, no upsell on garbage that I didn't need. Pretty happy all in all. Nice guys, quick turn around. UPDATE: I brought my FJ in this last week 2/12/13, I had personally installed some new front struts on it as well, same deal, they aligned it, did a great job, no upsell garbage. It runs straight, no greasey hand prints on anything and I couldn't be happier. Great place to go.",Positive
"I would not use a shop like this to do major repairs, but for any simple flushes it is perfect. I went here on 12/7/11 and got a brake fluid flush for $29.99 after coupon. Best price anywhere. Rob was very nice and did not ever try to upsell me on anything. I was in an out in about 30 minutes. Great service. For real auto repairs I'd probably use a mechanic shop. There are some locally owned in the area which are reasonable priced.",Positive
"My husband took my car in to Brake Masters a few Saturday's ago due to my AC blowing cool, not cold, air. Seemed like a pretty simple fix- add some coolant and we'll be on our way. They were convenient because they are open on Saturdays and don't require an appointment. He dropped the car off so they could analyze the issue and would call us later with the diagnosis. They called with the coolant suggestion, but then started going on about how it could be the compressor but they wouldn't immediately know, they'd put dye in the coolant and we were to bring the car back in a week so they could see if it was leaking, etc. Red flags went up in my mind, but he thought they were just covering all bases up front. Ok... just add the coolant and we'll deal with the compressor later if that's the real problem, maybe next summer since it's finally cooling off here in the desert. Now, I am not saying they intentionally tried to take advantage of us, but you be the judge... My husband takes me to pick up my car later that afternoon and I set off for the 20 minute ride home. Immediately, I notice its blowing hot air- heater hot, not it just needs to cool off from sitting in the sun hot, and the compressor is ""struggling""- the fan is cutting on and off, on and off, over and over. We pull in the garage and I call my husband over to hear the compressor and feel the air. He agrees something definitely isn't right so we drive back up to Brake Masters (another 20 minutes, which by then is brutally hot) and I tell the guy about the new issues and, he immediately dismisses me, tells me it's the compressor, and will be $1200 to fix. I ask how it's possible my car is now worse than it was when it was brought in and he gives some excuse of how there could have been a restriction (my technical terms are lacking as I am not a mechanic but you get the picture) or something that got forced through when they added the coolant making the real issue more apparent. He was so unapologetic, and kind of seemed to blame me for a lack of service in my car (I just bought the car a year ago). I asked if he could do it that day and lucky for me, he didn't have the compressor kit in stock but could do it Monday. My husband's and my work schedules didn't permit bringing my car back on Monday and the mechanic's attitude made me so mad I vowed to have anyone but him put a new compressor in my car. I went straight home and emailed a few shops I found online with good reviews (closed by then on Saturday) and decided which ever one called me first on Monday would get my business. The ending to this saga- I tell the new shop I need a new compressor- they tell me they will be the judge of that and my car may just need coolant. OK, whatever.... They call me later and ask if I had recently had coolant added to my car because it seemed that the issue was my car had too much added which can cause a compressor to do what mine was doing. I tell them the whole story, they go back to see if the added dye from Brake Masters uncovered any issues but call me again with the good news that my car was fine, they fixed the coolant problem and my compressor works perfectly. I guess in Brake Masters defense, my husband said they were short staffed that day, and maybe they weren't monitoring the coolant so it could have been an accident they added too much. What I also know though, without a doubt, is they would have installed the compressor kit without a second thought and charged me $1200 for a problem they created. I will not take my car back there, they may be fine for oil changes and hopefully brakes as their name states, but I'll take my chances with the proven honest mechanic I happened upon because of this fiasco.",Negative
They advertise the oil change which comes down to $19.95 with the coupon that's on their website. Once I got there and got the oil change it all added up to $29.99. When I asked why so much I was told it included some disposal fee. Normally that should be part of the package. So basically I overpaid by $10 because their price and coupon marketing is a little deceiving. Wouldn't go back.,Negative
"My experience with all mechanics/brake shops/dealer service centers has always been that you go in for 1 thing and by the end of the day you've practically upgraded the whole car! That is not the case with this Brake Masters. I went in for what I thought would be a simple fix and it was. I was pleased to get the phone call that everything looked great except the thing I came in for. They fixed the brakes properly, quickly and didn't try to upsell me anything! It was a great experience and I will return in the future.",Positive
"These guys seem reputable, and they had the best price for an oil change/tire rotation package I could find. They detailed some work which needed to be done to my braking system. I'll take it to another brake shop to verify their suggestions.",Positive
I am so glad that I go to brakes plus other places have tried to rip me off so many times because I'm an older woman I can always count on Sean who has always treated me fairly and giving me great prices I will never go anywhere else for brakes oil changes alignments etc. Thank you for your honesty and professionalism,Positive
Beware: I called and asked for a quote on back breaks on my Audi 2007 after getting a inspection done from the Audi dealership reveled i needed to replace my back breaks. I am niw ti Arizona and only called after driving by seeing the place so didnt really know much about them. When I called for wuote gave them my information they offered me standard cost $99 or Premium I chose the $99 I asked what the cost was including labor and he said $99 i said with labor for both back breaks he said yes. I said sorry I keep asking just seems really cheap. He said come on in and so we went in to dropped off car and decided to go with a oil change too even though it was 59.99 thought what the heck why not if the breaks were $99. They called a few hours later said the rotor need replacing as well and Audo need a special tool and that would also be a extra tool. When i asked you don't have tool they said yeah we have it but its not free. Basically we need to pay them to use the tool on the car. Also the front had a open boot and that too needs to be replaced. So they now said it would be $393 we said no to that as obviously this was outrageous cost and they were pulling ine over on us. We went in to pick up car and paid for oil change when the guy tried to justify the cost and then said if you dontvreplace that open boot your axel will fall off seriously where did they go for mechanic school that isnt its purpose to hold rhe axel on lol. Maybe they have done this to others but not working in us. Not trustworthy place or people. We took car over to don inlaw who is a mechanic to do the work parts new rotors premium pad under $100 was about 2 hour job for him. The thing that ticks us off most is they overtightened the wheels way beyond the recommended. So beware of this place get your wuote in writing and do your own research on pricing.,Negative
"OWNER...... please read 1 star reviews below. Just like sexual harassment, corruption in auto repair needs to STOP! Everyone, get a SECOND OPINION or else this place will continue to hurt people. Try running your business on good old fashion honesty, hard work and integrity. PLEASE POST YOUR REVIEWS ONLINE and on the BBB website so others are WARNED!!!",Negative
These guys acted like it was absurd to ask for my oil change to be done in two hours even though I had an appointment and even when I explained to him that the car was needed to transport a bride and groom to their wedding. The guy at the front desk was really rude. Don't waste your time coming here if an appointment means that you still have to wait 3 hours to get a basic oil change.,Negative
"These guys are a joke! Went to go in to get brakes done & immediately said I needed new rotors. I went into the shop to inspect myself and as I suspected they were full of BS! Nothing wrong with the rotors and they continue to inform me that they cannot be turned again according to Arizona regulations. Hahahaha, sure enough I went somewhere else within the hour got rotors turned with new brakes (ceramic) and costs $169 less! These guys thought they were so smart but yet I got the last laugh. Don't go to these people they will rip you off! They're more concerned with lining their own pockets than to do the right thing and give honest opinions about your car.",Negative
These guys save me money every time I'm here. I was in a Firestone a week ago and they told me I needed about $700 worth of work. I brought it it for a second opinion and they said there wasn't anything wrong with my car. They've always been this way. They won't spend your money needlessly. Extremely trustworthy!!!!!,Positive
Justin is the BEST! Hubby out of town when car sprung a leak and he took care of everything!! Mind you that it was 530 Friday afternoon right before closing!!!! Awesome working out by six!,Positive
I know it pinions are like assholes everybody has one and some are bigger than others but it is my opinion that if you get your brakes done by a professional company like Brakes Plus and you only use your car to drive to and from work mainly and it's low mileage and it's got a lifetime warranty on the pads that if it goes wrong and you need new rotors because the pads didn't last why would you have to pay for the labor and new rotors ..they should have done right the first time.. to have them come out and give you a bill for $1685 is ridiculous all because the brakes they put on it the first time did not work,Negative
"Took my cars here over the past two years, but today I felt the guy behind the counter was just rude. I will never go back to this place. There are plenty of other places that will take my money. And they don't refill the wiper fluid.",Negative
"I am really let down about my most recent transaction with these guys. I have brought my vehicles here on multiple occasions for routine maintenance and everything seemed on the up and up. I bought a used vehicle that was having trouble starting so I trusted that they would honestly diagnose it, I was WRONG. Joseph Miller the location manager told me I needed and fuel pump and it would cost around $600. I decided to go ahead and have a ""fuel pump"" installed. I put quotations because I'm not even sure if they actually installed one. When I went to pick my vehicle up I immediately noticed the same issue. Joe told me that it was completely normal and that it started right up for him. long story short all my vehicle needed was a $200 fuel pressure regulator. STEER CLEAR OF THIS BRAND AND LOCATION! Find a mom and pop where the employees still have integrity and take pride in their work.",Negative
DO NOT GO HERE!!!! These guys tried scamming me and charging me 500 dollars for a master cylinder when the brakes just needed to be bled! There was no leak and they said that's what was the problem...they are dishonest and don't even inspect the car. They were very rude and had horrible customer service. They are liars. I had to tell them to put my car back together and go to another shop. The shop I went to for a second opinion fixed my problem for 40 dollars and my problem was gone by such a simple fix....not a wrong diagnosis.,Negative
"They do not inspect the cars and cannot fix brakes properly. They are running a scam here. Pass this one by, go somewhere else! I had to pay twice then go to the dealer for the third time and they fixed my problem, which was NOT the brakes! OR the calipers. Scam!",Negative
"#ZERO STARS# Not honest people working here. Took my car in to get the brakes looked at, and they told me everything is fine. I took my car in because of a brake grinding issue, I know how to change brakes and know why they make noises. Clearly my brake pads are about gone, taking it in to see what they think, (mainly wondering are my rotors damaged at this point). After they ""inspect"" they hand me my keys and say ""everything looks good, thanks for coming in"" Complete crap, I knew better than to believe that shenanigans. Took my car to the dealer the following week, they said my brakes were damn close to damaging my rotors, just as I suspected. Do not go to this location.",Negative
"These guys are incredible. Joe, the manager, is the man and always Takes care of my vehicles when something goes wrong. I live in San Tan Valley and there are plenty of auto mechanics between my place and here but the quality of work and honesty displayed here is not something I can pass up.",Positive
Longest hour and a half of my life! If you claim that you will provide a service within an hour and a half you should probably start on it before I come back to check on the progress Three hours later. I have other things to do. Thanks for lying to me and wasting my time. Took my car back before they wasted any more if my time.,Negative
"I've gone to Brakes Plus two times to have work done on my car. They are close to my office and the service I've received both times has been outstanding. The first time, my tail light was out and I needed a quick replacement bulb. They replaced my bulb for free, which was such a nice surprise. I went back to have my front brakes and rotors replaced. I was given a quote and decided to have the work done. An hour later, my work was completed and I was ready to go. The staff at Brakes Plus was professional and treated me with respect. They did not try to rip me off or sell me ""upgrades"" to my brake service. As a female, this was truly appreciated. I will definitely go back for all my automotive repair needs.",Positive
"Here is a shop that operates with honesty and integrity. I always get nervous going to a shop for the first time because I don't want to be talked into something I don't really need, but after my first two experiences here, I won't go anywhere else. I had my wheel cylinders and front brake pads replaced back in December. Fast forward five months, and I get in my car one afternoon and the brake pedal goes to the floor. Luckily it still came to stop but I knew that I had to get in to see what was going on. Although there are many other ""brake"" shops around, I decided to drive back down to this shop just in case it was something that was previously worked on. They got my car in right away and luckily I was covered by a warranty (phew) so the work I needed done was at no cost. I was out of there in just a couple of hours. There's more work that needs to be done on my car, and although I let Jason know that I have already been quoted a price, he looked it up again and tried to find ways to save me money. For someone who is on a tight budget and finds it hard to justify putting hundreds on dollars into a car that is on it's last leg, I'm incredibly appreciative.",Positive
"I had already been quoted $1200 to repair 2 wheel bearings, sway bar connections & strut mounts by other shop. Joe evaluated my symptoms and showed me I didn't have problems with those. Instead only needed CV joints replaced which had gaping holes in boots. ( not found by other shop). Cost $400. I walked in telling Joe what I thought I needed so I was already sold. He would not take advantage. For honesty like that I will drive 50 miles to get.",Positive
"Overall satisfaction: A+, Helpful and Knowledgeable staff, Fast Service, No unnecessary pressure or work added Most people dread taking their car in for service...and I am no exception. I am however a female and I think we dread it more. I am always on the lookout for an honest mechanic shop that does not take advantage of it's customers (female or not) and I have found it at this Brakes Plus location. Along with the basic service (oil changes, tire rotations, etc), I have had some major repairs (engine mount) and some not so major (small oil leak) taken care of at this location. Regardless of what service they are performing I am always informed (and most times SHOWN A+!!) what the issue is, what the options are and then given the choice of what I would like to do. There is never any high pressure sales tactics used, just honest conversations about what needs or should get done and when. When I do have service work, it is taken care of in a timely manner. I normally have to wait for the car and the staff is constantly checking in and letting me know the status. A special thank you to Joe. He is always courteous, helpful and knowledgeable. I believe he makes it a point to know his customers and build those lasting relationships....it may be that we share a common interest/fascination of motorcycles, however I think it is his overall good nature that makes his customers feel at ease. :-) I have enjoyed (as much as anyone can enjoy a mechanic shop) using this Brakes Plus location and will continue to make it my go-to place when I need car maintenance or work/repairs. Updated 08/06/2013 from 4 stars to 5 stars as I have consistently seen spot on customer service and quality work from this shop.",Positive

"Strike 3 and you are out! I have ordered pizza from this place for the very last time. They brought an incorrect order the last 2 times. This time, my third and last, the order taker seemed to doubt that I had a coupon? What the heck...hassling me about coupons!? And then hang up angry on me? Like I am bad for having a coupon...come on man! I will be shocked if the pizza even arrives. Do yourself a favor, avoid being treated like a thief because you have a coupon...get your pie elsewhere.",Negative
"(This is only regarding their Casey's Made to Order Pizza) The Taco Pizza is AMAZING. For a large Taco pizza, it costs about $16 bucks. It's HUGE and has about 5 times as many toppings as any other pizza joint I've ever eaten at. The price is so fair for what you get and it tastes great for just a ""Gas Station Pizza."" Seriously, people, try it. It doesn't look like you'll have a good time getting gas...but at least get a pizza!",Positive
I buy gas from here all the time. Now all of a sudden today they take a $75 hold on my account after I already pay for my gas and it's taking me calling corporate and my bank to get my money back. Never happened before but I bet I won't be buying shit else from them.,Negative
"So this is a typical gas station store with pizza food service. I know I'm not all that smart with food items, but I felt sorely disappointed with the word ""ground beef"" as one of the toppings for their specialty taco pizza. I was expecting the type of meat that you'd see in a taco at Taco Bell, but all I got was sausage. I definitely felt lied to; the website should have just said it had sausage in it. Not only that but they were five minutes late with my order. The only good thing about this place is that they put a lot of toppings on your pizza. I also really wanted to get some donuts, but they had such a bleak and paltry selection that I passed on it.",Negative
So happy they have propane gas. Service was pretty awesome and the price. Well you can't force it to be cheaper. $4.59 a Gallon. They are quite knowledgeable too.,Positive

"One of the few do it yourself car wash businesses still available. It's older, but always clean and in good repair. The automatic wash does a good job and it is economical, and it doesn't have those terrible tire guides that ruin your tires. The vacuums work well and the self serve wash bays are awesome. I only wish they had the centralized machine to pay with your debit card so I wouldn't have to use our card",Positive
The one star is for the only guy out of ten at the car wash. I sat in the car wash drive. Waiting no one said a word to me until this over weight chick stopped smoking her cigarette.,Negative
This is my go to pace for BBQ propane. They always have friendly service and they refill propane tanks. The service station is generally clean - inside and out. They also have a self car wash section behind the store. I do not purchase fuel or other products because the pricing in this station is higher than average.,Positive
"Today; 7 November 2015 at around 1255 I had a the worst experience I've had at a car wash and with a car wash owner. I've used the automatic car wash at this location at least 4 times in the past and enjoy how clean it got my truck. Well, today the car wash's wand decided to bump into the rear quarter panel of my truck; TWICE! I could do nothing but sit and watched as it bumped against my truck. I let the wash go through its cycle and when I exited the car wash I pulled to the side to see what the wand hand done and oh it did something... It scratched my bed liner that hangs over the bed and it scratched my paint. I went inside to see who I needed to speak to about the issue. The attendant called a worker to look at my truck and a lady (wife of the manager) came out and stated that didn't happen here. The went inside to look at the video and came out saying that it didn't happen here. I refused to accept that and she said I can wait for her husband to show up, not even 30 seconds later her husband (the manager) walks out, rubs his thumb on the scratches and states I don't even think this happened here. The color of the wand was even on the paint! He would not try anything today and refused to see if the scratches had dug deep enough. He told me to come back another day because he was too busy to try and buff the scratches today... I explained how I live in centennial hills and a journey down here wasn't convenient for me. My inconvenience was not if his concern.... Once this issue gets settled; I sadly won't be coming back to this car wash; due to the risk of the wand and working with the owner...",Negative
Water from the wash is dirty and minimal water is set on the wand wash system. Don't bother looking for a clean car here !,Negative
"Washed my car here for the first time and is in a convenient location. Great experience overall. Only complaint was that, there seems to be sewage system near by the place and it smelled awful.",Positive
Gas is priced competitively. They have a solid amount of self-service vacuums and car wash stations as well as one automatic touchless system. The area has always been clean in the three times I've gone and will continue to come her!,Positive
Staff is always friendly & automatic Carwash is priced right and makes my ride sparkle. I've been frequenting this business since 2006 or 2007 and never had a bad experience.,Positive
not even a star for these creatures!! if you want to have a good business....don't have crackheads outdise you're store..in the lots... asking for money. doing deals and drugs on your lot! metro won't even come out ..another story. the employees are scary too. amanda... beyond a bitch! and rude as hell. dont need to hear you're life story ...you're at work shut up!! go elsewhere!!,Negative
Circle K has a great deal for fountain drinks $.89 for the 44 oz. but this visit I stopped by to use the red box and all you see is sketchy people in the front. Like a hang out for beggars ! Next time I'll try to stop at a different time.,Negative
Watch closely before you get of your vehicle here and keep your head up when you exit the store or pump gas. This place is crawling with drunks and tweakers hanging around who are all friends with the security who let them hassle the paying customers,Negative
"Employees are nice, convenient to where I live, but as others have said, very busy and hard to drive in/out of as cars are coming from all directions. Also, the people asking for money, they've been here doing this the same amount of time I've lived in this area, 7 years. It's the same people! I've counted twice I've been to this plaza and haven't been asked for money. Drive slow as there are people walking and driving everywhere here.",Negative
"Very nice gas station. The inside mini-mart is very nice, clean, and well stocked. BUT this gas station gets reallly busy and people in this parking lot do not know how to drive. Its sometimes even difficult to find a parking spot. They do have a two Red Boxes, which is nice, but I have had to wait on at least one person every time I try to get a movie. Mainly I go here to fill up my 5-gallon water jugs at their outdoor Glacier water station. Can't complain about the water station itself, but I often feel very uncomfortable getting water here. This gas station seems to attract a sketchy crowd and there are always odd characters about. A few times I have gone and there has been homeless people camped out right next to the water station. Its very uncomfortable and I find myself anxiously awaiting the jug to fill. I usually will go somewhere else, even though this place is the closest to my house, just because I don't feel comfortable or like dealing with that parking lot.",Negative
"Since Las Vegas doesn't have QuikTrip stores like Phoenix, I've been stuck in convenience store purgatory since moving here. This Circle K kind of illustrates what I'm talking about. It's at a busy corner but it's kind awkward to get in and out of if you're not coming from specific directions to it. Inside they have two side by side fountain drink dispensers with several choices, and the drinks are reasonably priced. But cheap fountain drinks without cups, lids, and straws being stocked might as well not even be advertised. The store seems to draw some gang graffiti in the bathrooms too. But they also offer a walk in beer cooler and have a well sized selection of bottled drinks. Back outside they have one thing that is absolutely insane: $50 limits on debit / credit card transactions. Hey Circle K management, your competition has phased this silly restriction out. If I have to run 2 transactions to top off my tank why should I bother with your pumps? Oh that's right, I won't. Long story short this Circle K is one of the poster children for the cause of begging QuikTrip to expand to the Vegas market with cleaner stores and no silly payment card restrictions. 2 Stars....and that's pushing it. And clean up the gang graffiti please.",Negative
"Wish this was the Circle K closest to us, Great selection on fountain drinks, plenty of gas pumps. Usually friendly staff",Positive
"I prefer this place to QT. Improved craft beer selection, great new espresso/latte machine, and USB ports to charge your devices. Well done Circle K. P.S. David is great!",Positive
"I bought gas at this location and needed to use the restroom so I walked in and asked the clerk where it was. He pointed me in the right direction and when I got to the men's bathroom it was out of order. I walked over to the women's as is the standard when a bathroom is out of order. As I was going in a sales associate says ""Excuse me, please don't. Just don't. I'm about to clean that."" I reply that the men's is out of order and she still doesn't want me to use it because she's about to clean it. Then she says it's because it's a women's bathroom and that I should ask her next time. Because I need to ask permission to use a public restroom. I don't disagree with the sentiment but the attitude and tone was extremely rude and confrontational for no reason. She was a dark haired young woman working at 7:20 PM on 6/3/16. She needs to work on her people skills and circle K needs to train their employees to be more polite to paying customers.",Negative
"Interesting how Circle K locations are now beginning to look like their QuikTrip competitor. Anyway, I stopped in for a few things on a few occasions on the way home from work. This is a massive Circle K and the place inside is clean, modern, and well-stocked. The gas pumps are plentiful and getting in and out of this location is fine, especially if coming west or southbound. Each time I've been in, the employees are nice and friendly. The only negative I could pick up on this location was the fact that there does tend to be people asking for money out front. The last time in particular was tough because it was a woman with her two kids asking for change. Other than that, this is a very modern and nice Circle K location to stop off at and I think 5-stars are in order.",Positive
"This circle k is new. It is clean and we'll stocked. The employees are friendly, and it is large so it is easy to maneuver. Also the gas pumps are easy to get to, which is very important for me. Another important factor for me is that if I don't feel like spending $7 at Starbucks, I can always count on circle k for great coffee.",Positive
"Great new Circle K at the intersection of 7th St and Missouri. Nice new addition to the exploding revitalization that is happening in North Central Phoenix. I stopped for gas last night, will be back to investigate further.",Positive
"These people deserve a THOUSAND stars. They are HONEST people. God bless all of them. This is the deal, I have a 2002 Ford Mustang GT that needed a transmission and I knew an honest price would be around $1,500 because my husband and I come from a long list of mechanics. The problem is that they all live on the east coast. Anyway, after being quoted double from other repair shops and Aamco quoted 5k to do the transmission (I knew Aamco were a bunch of cons after that conversation), I found Copperstate and let me tell you, GREAT, Hard working but more importantly, HONEST. They quoted me exactly what I knew the cost should be and what else can I say. I am more than a happy customer, I will forever be a repeated customer. They take pride in their work!!! I truly encourage people who need transmission work to go here and help a family who truly deserves the business as opposed to rip off places such as Aamco and other leaches. These people Are honest and great. If I had extra cash to blow, I would have tipped them $1k, even more if I could. Very good family. They have won my trust and heart. Thank you, thank you, thank you Copperstate and Veronica and everyone there. May God bless you all. I wish you all the best and good health and a lot of success because YOU ALL deserve it. With great appreciation and admiration, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Tina & Nick",Positive
"Repeat customers!! Lost a transmission & a transfer case in my Chevy Tahoe. Got the transmission and the day of pick up I dropped the transfer case off. I sprung it on this company. The father took the transfer case off the truck and in the time it took me to go into the office to speak with the daughter in the office. He had it stripped and knew what was wrong!! I authorized the work. I live 145 miles away and my wife at the time was having hip surgery at a hospital around the corner. He said wait and I will have it done in about 2 hours. He was loading it up in the back of my truck 1 hour later!! Its been over a year now and the truck runs flawless. Quality is what this company is ALL about. I am amazed at the way they run their business and how fair the prices are. Look no farther than Copper State Transmissions. During yet another crappy moment in our lives, they made it better. Thank you guys! amigos hasta la morte The Benson's!!!",Positive
I would highly recommend recommend Copperstate Transmission for all your transmission work. My transmission failed and Gabriel's quote was half what other shops were telling me. He put in a rebuilt unit that is working great! His communication was on point and the work was done right when he said it would. With the high reviews and the two year warranty he provided I am confident there will be no issues.,Positive
"Gabriel owns the most honest transmission company I have ever used. I would trust this guy with my life. He went above and beyond driving to me when my transmission was acting up so he could see first hand what it was doing. I took my Range Rover to 3 other places and they all wanted to charge me between $5000.00 and $8000.00 depending on what they said it "" Might need a new valve body"" Because they really were just buying a Beans new transmission from Land Rover and swapping it out. Gabriel said we can rebuild the transmission and valve body. This transmission is running like a sewing machine. This guy knows what he's doing because that's all he does is transmissions. Great Job Gabriel and Thanks again...!!!!!!!!!! A+ I will use and recommend this company as long as he is in business.!",Positive
"Took a transmission to Pro Tech Transmissions on bell road and was being raped. Below is the story and feed back I left on their page. Classic bait and switch. Reverse went out in my truck. Drove it from Prescott AZ to Phoenix AZ. Over the phone they said ""950.00"" plus hard parts (350.00) on high side. Few days go by and I call them and they tell me ""Your Transmission was shot"". The truck would not even drive up onto the lift. (TOTAL BULLSHIT). I said You're full of shit I drove it from 125 miles to you and it was fine, and you want me to believe the entire transmission never slipping in any gear except Reverse and took a shit from where I parked it... to your lift? 45 feet? I knew where this was going. They hand me back my transmission in pieces and hand me a bill for 950.00. So I authorized the work. When it was done and I was going to pick it up is where it gets even better..... 3,200.00 for a basic Chevy 4L80E transmission. I could have bought a performance transmission for this price. 3 year 36k miles. (most people drive 36k miles in 2 years) So its a 2 year guarantee. So the front desk guy calls and gets me ""financing"". The people bring him over two checks. Finance guy gives the guy up front a kick back check and pays the company. (I have been in sales and I know what I witnessed) Guy behind the desk says to not say anything to the owner. After Fiance charges and set up fees $3,525.14!! I make decent money and I have paid off the loan in a month and a half. In that time it was 8.00 a day in interest in the 1st 2 weeks (130.25 interest in two weeks). Once I made the 2,000.00 payment 2 weeks later, It dropped down to 4.00 a day in interest. in that month it generated (140.86 in interest) I am not mad about the loan company, I know and understand they are high risk in their industry. What I am livid about is the way this company bait and switched me. While waiting for this truck to be fixed by The crooks at Pro Tech Transmissions. I lost my other transmission in my other truck (4L60) I called up Copper State Transmissions at 1121 S 21st ave Phoenix AZ and I bought the Rebuilt transmission and a new torque converter 1 year warranty 12,000 miles for 650.00 out the door. Family owned and operated. Veronica was amazingly helpful during this time. I was happy to know there are still honest shops out there, We just have to find them. Copper State is family owned and operated. I met the father, son and daughter and they are amazing people. These folks will be the only people I do business.",Positive
"I researched and talked to a couple of other transmission shops and decided to take my car to Copperstate. They were very friendly both on the phone and in person. Plus they did a great job installing a rebuilt transmission in 1 day, there were no surprise expenses and the price was significantly less than the other shops that I had contacted. I would definitely use them again and highly recommend them.",Positive
"Not only did Copperstate take my truck in to swap out a rebuilt 4L60E transmission take in my Blazer within 24 hours of my call, the repair was done the same day! No extra hidden charges... everything was done as promised. As I work in North Scottsdale, the guys even stayed after hours to allow me time to make the trip to their shop and get my Blazer back on the road! Kudos all around... my highest recommendations! Thank you so much Copperstate.",Positive
They rebuilt 2 of our vehicles transmission they were recommended by a small dealership and they did a wonderful job! I would highly recommend them. Very nice staff!,Positive
There's only two individuals who I trust to work on my Busa. The dealership and Dave with Cycle Tech. Dave has worked on my bikes over the years beginning at his first shop. If you're looking for an honest straight up cool dude for all your Cycle needs Dave and his crew at Cycle Tech are the men to handle it. I've always had a pleasant experience with Dave and the crew. Thanks guy!,Positive
Place was great had a decent experience. Price was good for an oil change on my 2016 breakout. Would recommend this place will be going back for my next change,Positive
They came to my house and picked up my bike and took it back to their shop and made all the repairs necessary for a good price. Now my bike is ready for the road and rides great!,Positive
I took my bike to this repair shop for the first time and it went well. The workers seemed like cool people and I also did not get any overcharge bs. I mostly spoke with Dave fyi. Repairs took maybe a week longer than I would have wanted but I am over all satisfied with the repair experience. I would definitely recommend this repair shop to a friend.,Positive
"Visited Cycle Tech needed a part for my VTX 1800 motorcycle and this was the last shop that I called before giving up and, guess what they had it. The customer service is divine and they are so genuinely happy that one is excited to hand over their hard earned money and buy the part they need to fix the bike and be at least joyful about spending 159 to fix it. Will return here, first when need a part in the future. And ladies this is the place to buy parts for your own bike or that special man in our lives that is so busy that needs us to go get it. They do not treat us lady riders like we should not be riding.",Positive
"I bought a used Yamaha R6 motorcycle and it had died on me on the freeway. I took a look and saw that Cycle tech had a lot of 5 star reviews from a lot people, even from different states. It was pleasant initially because the workers there seemed to be riders themselves and they were also fixing bikes when mine had came up there and since it was motorcycle season I was expecting it to take a while to fix my motorcycle. I had brought my motorcycle at the beginning of May. I told them about what happened to my bike and said that several of my friends (who also told me to go to this place) that it could be my stator and rectifier that had gone out. They listened to my concerns and we signed the paperwork for the motorcycle to be fixed at the shop. I had waited a week and there wasn't any calls, though one of the mechanics said they would give me a call in a few days after running some diagnostics. The second week I had called in again for an update, one of the reps said that they had put it on a stand and they're currently checking it out and would call me the following day. It was almost the end of the third week and there wasn't any calls back. I had contacted them again; I believe I spoke with Dave (the owner) this time and he said it was the stator and rectifier (that I had originally thought) wasn't giving enough voltage to keep the bike running and the parts were ordered and the bike should be ready to go by next week. It was a full month at this point and I had called them again. They said the part they ordered didn't fit my bike and that they had to make a few modifications to it and said it would be done the next day. The next day came, i tried calling and no one had picked up. The following Monday, the bike was finally fixed. I was happy to get back onto the road after having to borrow cars, pay friends for rides, and use uber just to get to work. . . for a month. It was about a week and a half later that my motorcycle died exiting the freeway and the motorcycle completely died. When I had tried to start it back up it turned on and i heard metallic break off inside and it wouldn't completely turn on afterwards. I had to rent out a truck to bring the motorcycle to another company. This whole thing has been a headache. I had sincerely wanted to have a pleasant time with this company because of all the reviews and recommendation from friends, talking to the mechanics there had made me really hopeful, but I should have been more attentive to the reviews, it seems like most of them were years ago. I guess I was the unlucky one. Two stars... the only reason why I didn't give one was because their customer service was great. I wish they had treated my bike the same way.",Negative
"Lake Havasu Az. Motorcycle bike shops are so independent that they won't even call you back after you call about service work. Honda trike work is completely out for ""ALL"" shops in Havasu unless you have a ""HARLEY"" We called Cycle Tec and they worked on my trike with no issues. Made an appointment and drove to Las Vegas from Lake Havasu. Nick was super nice and very helpful in answering all my concerns. Very reasonable prices. Highly recommend them to anyone needing motorcycle work.",Positive
Seriously I've been coming to get all my bikes worked on here for YEARS! They're the only ones I trust in Vegas to actually do incredible work! Thanks to Dave (owner) for always answering my questions (no matter how silly they might be) and for always involving himself in all the builds! Both Nicks never have a problem going the extra mile and doing some extra work! They'll beat any other shop in price and quality. THANKS GUYS!,Positive
"David did a great job checking out my soft tail chopper after I bought it used and getting it dialed in for me. Took a few days longer that I expected but all the work done with 1st time quality and just the way I wanted it set up (electrical birds nest, cables, grip and pegs). All done at a reasonable price. Don't be scared off by all the crotch rockets in the shop, these guys can also do great work on Harleys.",Positive
"Recently I purchase a motorcycle gsxr I ride to the DMV and all of a sudden bike will not start I was panicking and one of my friends recommended Cycle tech Nick and Dave is the best by far I ever encounter when it comes to customer service this people really do care about their customers they answer the phone and with out no hesitation he said ""don't worry I will send somebody to pick your bike and give you a ride"" and I say WOW you guys are super awesome. The next day they called me and told me about how much the repair cost. I also ask them to install my new full set of fairings. Came back next day bike is ready up and running flawless!!! Installation of fairings is also perfect I highly recommend CYCLE TECH to every single bikers out there and to all the people that works at this place you guys earn my business thank you so much!!!",Positive
Thanks for the awesome services on my Honda vtx 1300 intake install .And also thank you Dave for tuning it perfectly .Cycle tech is the best motorbike shop in town and they will treat you like family .,Positive
"I expected so much more based on the reviews. All the dealerships are overpriced and in most cases ill-equip to handle service. Bottom line, they completely ignored 2 issues I brought my bike in with and they charged a ridiculous amount for a 1.5qt oil change. They barely talked to me. I'll go back to doing my own work. No place in town I can find that is is worth the money to save the time!",Negative
"went with rims in hand for new tires mount and balance, rates are average,they change the first tire en 5 min but the guy went to reception and never come back or sent someone else to finish the job, i wait for 30 mins not one help me out or ask me if i was getting help and i was the only one there waiting for the service ...finally i ask someone else and another guy help me out but put the tires backwards, lucky me i notice before leave, at the end they took over an hour for tires change and mounting, even with the wheels off the bike. only reason i went there was because yelp reviews, i rather go back to the shop that use to go before...",Negative
"Did good work on my metric cruiser at a reasonable price, finished a little earlier than expected. I believe they even wiped the bike down before bringing it out. can't really ask for more!",Positive
My husband went to get his light fix on his Honda and they figure out what the problem was and fix it. My husband had tried several different locations and even a friend who works on bikes and no one dare to want to work on it. They all said it was too much to do and were quoting high estimates. Cycle Tech was very professional and did a fantastic job. Nick and Devin were the ones that figure out why my husband's light didn't work. Their prices were reasonable and got it done in only a few hours. We highly recommend anyone who needs their motorcycle fix to go here.,Positive
Big Shout out to the guys at Cycle Tech Nick & Badger. I bought my first bike and had a lot of questions and needed some minor stuff done to it. They took the time to help me out even though they were really busy . Real cool guys Will definitely come back in the future.,Positive
"Badger, nick, and dave are awesome.....wouldn't take my bike anywhere else....polite....helpful.....taught me lots about my bike",Positive
"Bike was fixed & I was on my way & haven't had a problem since. Bikes perfect, cost was low, & work is legit. Can't get any better. Thank you! Definitely a thumbs up and would RECOMMEND! and.... and... they're HONEST! See Badger or Dave!",Positive
I ride a motorcycle all over the country been to a few repair shops. Cycle tech treated me like I was a long time friend. Fast courteous professional. Great bunch of guys. I'm from akron oh they got me in right away replaced frt wheel brgs and fork seals. Recommend them to all bikers,Positive
"Dave, Badger & CO. were awesome!!! Fairly priced shop, trustworthy and everyone there polite and very friendly! Brought in two cruisers, and I'm very happy with the choice I made. Will comeback. Thank you Cycle Tech! Raz",Positive
"Being new to the area, I was nervous in finding a shop to fix and maintain my bike.. The reviews here are spot on! Cycle Tech has a great group of guys who were very easy to deal with and gave me plenty of options in rebuild the engine on my KTM. very pleased by the way they run the business and will be a returning customer! I highly recommend Cycle Tech",Positive
Best place hands down for repairs and parts for your motorcycle or quad.Guys that work there are real cool and let you see what they are doing to your bike.Whoever goes to ride now for there bike stop!!! AND GO TO THESE GUYS.,Positive
Badger is the man and Dave he took my pos bike and made it a beast for a amazing price i could not be happier no one will be as honest and as straightforward service they know their bikes and tuning,Positive
"These guys ROCK!!!!!! I'm very happy that I have found such a great team to work on my bike. They are upfront with you about everything they don't hide anything. You can call them and they will answer your questions. Have a 2000 Yamaha r1 that needed some love and BADGER gave it some love he is a very cool guy and knows his stuff. THANKS AGAIN CYCLE TECH. I would like to say thank you to these guys BADGER,DAVE,STEVE for the work you guys have done. I must say that I will never go to any other place to have work done on my bike. MUCH LOVE GUYS.......",Positive
"My boyfriend and I love us some cycle tech to say the least. Not only did he purchase his bike from them, but they have worked on mine numerous times. We have only really dealt with David, Badger, and Nick, and as far as we've seen they are all phenomenal . This last time Badger went out of his way to fix the back tire on my R6, with spare parts and was so extremely helpful. I appreciate this shop so much and everything they have done for us and will continue to do for us. We recommend them to all our bike buddies & will continue to do so. Thank you guys.(=",Positive
"Not only have I purchased a bike from cycletech. I've also had work done on many bikes including engine swaps, full services, diagnoses and accessories. I wouldn't go anywhere else. I've never had a problem, I've never been overcharged and work is done in quickly.",Positive
Cycle Tech is fantastic...Dave...Badger...Nick and Steve always take care of my bike when in need...very helpful with spare parts...and great all around guys...highly recommend to anyone looking to get work done on any type of motorcycle,Positive
"Nice guys that really know their stuff and keep it real. Honest mechanics are often hard to find, but they're undoubtedly trustworthy and it's the only shop I'll ever take my bike to. Prices are unbeatable in Vegas, service excellent every time. Thanks Cycle Tech, you've got a customer for life in me :)",Positive
I've taken my bike here numerous times and every time Dave has always been able to fix any issue I have had. The customer service is great and the prices and labor are way better than dealer prices.,Positive
Great work as always and the prices too. Dave is always top knotch in getting things done for you in the time frame promised.,Positive
"I have been to the service department twice. My opinion is at the end but here are the facts: - I received a sales email regarding winter tires. I decided they were a good price, responded and made an appointment. The appointment was confirmed, twice, along with the model of tire, twice. - On the second confirmation the receptionist mentions there is a small recall on my car and asks if I would like to get it fixed while it's in for service. Great! Good idea. Let's do it. - I bring the car in for service. I wait 2 hours at Yorkdale (nearby mall). I get a phone call - they never ordered the tires. They can't get them until tomorrow. But they will fix the recall now. I waited two hours for this news. - I wait another hour. Another phone call (I'm still waiting at the mall). They didn't realize that no one onsite is certified or able to fix the recall. They need to call in another person - that can be done tomorrow. - I waited over three hours for them to discover they can do none of the things they sold me on. - They offer to shuttle me home but I insisted on a rental vehicle as I should have had my car back already and I need my car to do my job.. They explained that they don't usually do that for a one day service. I replied that I'm assuming they also don't usually forget to order tires and offer services they can't perform and we came to an agreement that the rental car was a reasonable solution. - Two days later get my car back with winter tires, and I pay for storage onsite. - Spring 2018 arrives and I'm ready to put my regular tires back on. - After waiting one hour they call to say they can only find THREE of the tires I paid them to store. - I request for them to pay for two new tires because even their own service manager said putting one new tire on with three 3-year-old tires would be unsafe and unwise. - I take my remaining three tires home and wait for them to call me to confirm the tires have arrived. - I wait several days for confirmation that the tires have arrived. I call twice over the course of a week and both times I'm told someone will call me back. At the end of the week I call again and speak to a manager. They're there - just no one called. - They offer to pay for only one tire because one of my (three remaining) regular tires has a nail in it anyway. I explain that that was beside the point, I could have replaced that elsewhere, they offer me $20 off a $199 tire. Now on to my opinion: I would like to point out that I bought my car at Dean Myers Chevrolet and I regret it. While the purchase of the car was fine (not great, just fine), I regret ever spending money here. This dealership demonstrates a lack of accountability, organization and skill that is, quite frankly, shocking. Both of these visits have wasted countless hours and created problems to which I have had to provide solutions at every turn. I will not be returning to Dean Myers Chevrolet for service nor would I recommend buying a vehicle there.",Negative
"Firstly I would like to say that I am gravely disappointed with the treatment of the people from this place this service time around. My experience is still fresh in mind and I am very emotional about it. I brought my car (2004 Saturn Ion) in for an oil change service. I dealt with Brian, the service agent and he dealt with me pleasantly, like times before. After a hectic day, the service was done and I was on my way home. On Monday that just passed Aug 7, some noise was coming from my engine compartment and my husband got out and told me to pop the hood. I reached for the lever and it was flopping back and forth. I was shocked and couldn't believe it wasn't opening the hood. My husband came from bracing the hood in front of the car, got on his knees and looked at the lever and said that it was broken and that it would need a wrench to open. The following day (tuesday) I called and told them my situation and they booked me for today (wednesday) for further investigation. Long story shortened, They didn't tell me anything when i brought the car in and left without them telling me anything. Today for the FIRST time, i was told that it was hard to open my hood and after trying to understand, if it was so hard to open my hood and they still did the oil change and they allowed me to leave with a broken latch. I was very upset for a number of things: I did not bring a broken latch to the service, the tech said it came into the shop broken and there was no waiver presented or signed stating that they had seen this issue, brought it to my attention and going forward they are not liable for the issue. thirdly, afterwards before I left, they didn't tell me there was an issue and my forth issue is they are trying to rationalize that my car is old, i must have somehow did it and that in short, shit happens. I have a young child and If i had given them a car with a broken latch, I would also be inquiring for parts and repair because it is GRAVELY unsafe driving around with no access to the hood of your car. Secondly I would have advised them there was an issue in opening the hood and there would have been witnesses because the information would have passed through in notes, and to the service technician. The Manager of Service whose name is reserved had told me he would pay for the labor and I should pay for the part, but I was furious that I should pay anything because it was the technician who is liable. I don't think in any point of this experience was fair and it should be known to everyone else to beware of these types of things. I contacted Chris Fleming of the dealership and I am waiting for an investigation and resolve. In the meantime, Beware, these people have no moral standard for service whatsoever and I am left driving around in the meantime with a wrench to open my hood in case there is an issue because of somebody else's error.",Negative
"I had a great experience with Brian Betty selling my used car on consignment. He was friendly and got the results I wanted -- my car was sold within two weeks in the price range I requested -- it was actually at the top of the price range I expected, I had a cheque shortly afterwards and is was a positive transaction. It was much easier than I ever expected, and really hassle-free and handled professionally. Sarah K",Positive
Great service! Great services! Trade in program is great as well as the co-sign program. Having them help me to sell my car is very helpful.,Positive
"Have to agree with the review of Johnny H. below. VERY aggressive in trying to sell us a car TODAY, our first time visiting the dealer. My wife and I felt very uncomfortable, definitely will not be going back to look at cars here again. UPDATE: After out visit, they called us 3 times a day for a week trying to get us to come back in and buy. The one thing we DID ask them to do (e-mail us the details of the car we test drove) they never did. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE ALL AROUND.",Negative
"I think this place is kind of typical of a car dealership. They try to rope you in to extended warranties and the like. Then they get you with the service. I had really bad experiences here with the service department. If you live downtown, I'd highly recommend Cam's Auto Service on King Street East, east of Parliament.",Negative
"Awesome job on our Black Jaguar, looks mint! And he was on time and super nice. Will use again if I need to, hope I don't though",Positive
"Very honest guy. Evo drove to our place to look at 3 dents left by some asshole and their shopping cart. He very easily could have done what he could with them and gotten paid for it, but he said the bottom dent was just too deep and that we should take it to a body shop. He also recommended a shop to us. I really appreciate that level of professionalism.",Positive
Evo did an amazing job on my brand new Titan XD that had a rock thrown at it by some kid while driving down the road. He got rid of the dent and helped me apply the touchup paint.,Positive
"Evo did a wonderful job erasing a crease from a brand new Audi A4. I was inconsolable when it first happened - the car was not yet three weeks old! - but following Evo's handiwork it's like the dent never happened. His craftsmanship was complemented by great customer service - he was very friendly and responsive to my inquiries (and, believe me, I had a lot of them). He quoted a fair price and that's exactly what I paid. I'm very pleased with the overall experience and would recommend Dent Free to anyone who needs to get this kind of work done on their car.",Positive
"Decided to treat our car to some dent repairs after hitting her 5 year mark. Evo came exactly when he said he would and even got done earlier than expected. He honored the price quote given to me online. He fixed 3 dents, one of which was particularly bothersome (the kind that catches your eye if you even look in the direction of our car). Now you can't even tell the car had dents beforehand. I wouldn't hesitate to use their services again.",Positive
Evo has been fixing my car dents for years now. In fact he's the only one I trust to fix my cars dents. His work always exceeds my expectations. Always willing to go to the extent to meet your schedule. I recommend this guy to all of my friends and people I meet with dent problems on their vehicles. Nice guy and very professional as well.,Positive
"Could not be happier with Evo's work. I had a shopping cart damage the side of my brand new Porsche. The dealer's recommended body shop quoted me nearly $3,000 to repair the damage. Evo fixed my car and made it look brand new for less than $250! I highly recommend his work and will definitely use him again should I ever need it. Thank you!",Positive
"It is a pleasure to get to write an excellent review. I don't get to do it very often. Evo Dimitrov of Dent Free gets my highest recommendation. He showed up when he said he would, if fact a little early. He was pleasant and courteous, and most of all knew what he was doing. A rare thing these days. He did a masterful job of fixing a difficult dent on the rear of our Jeep Liberty and a door ding on our Chevy Malibu. After he was finished he charged exactly what he estimated. Again, a rare thing these days. We are truly happy with the work.",Positive
Evo did a great job fixing a small dent on the drivers side of my Altima. I sent him a message in yelp and got an instant reply. Next day he came by and fixed the dent. Thank you! I will definitely be contacting you in the future for any work done to my car.,Positive
Evo was a pleasure to deal with. He not only returned my call promptly when I requested an appointment but he arrived for the appointment 10 minutes early. I showed him the dent and asked a few other questions regarding minor scratches. He was very knowledgeable and offered some great advice. I would definitely use him again I'm the future.,Positive
"Evo is an absolute master when it comes to fixing dents! I have a Tesla Model S and am that guy that typically parks a football field away from anything (much to my wife's annoyance). A couple of nights ago, I took my daughter to a strip mall restaurant near my home with empty spaces all over. When I returned to my car 30 mins later, some inconsiderate uncaring a-hole parked soooo close to me that I had to let out all my breath to fit myself into the car. It was nighttime and I didn't notice any damage at the time but the next morning, I quickly realized that they had created a nasty dime sized dimple right under my door handle in the crease. After another dent repair shop in town tried to fix it and then couldn't (don't get me started, it was a bit of a nightmare), I called Tesla who empathetically told me that they felt bad for me but that it wasn't possible to fix a dent in the aluminum door crease. I looked online and saw differing opinions in the fan forums which gave me a shred of hope, and after reading other great reviews on Yelp, I gave Dent Free a call to see if there was anything else that could be done. Evo was totally understanding, at my house within a few hours, and besides being an incredibly nice guy, started to work on the car for almost 2 1/2 hours, working the dent out to perfection as only someone with a passion for this ""art"" could do. He didn't try to take any shortcuts and completely understood and demonstrated the obvious care that needed to be exercised with a car like this. Needless to say, I'm in his debt, and couldn't be happier to give him a wholehearted ecstatic recommendation as he brought my car back to showroom quality. If you have a particularly nasty ding, or just want the best to take care of your car, Evo is your guy! Thank you Evo!!!",Positive
My three car door dents have disappeared thanks to Dent Free! Affordable and convenient- came to my home. Highly recommend this company and Evo!,Positive
Amazing! I was so angry about that ding in my brand new car. You wouldn't even know it was there. Evo was professional and knowledgeable. Gave a ball park estimate from a photo before he came. Will recommend to all our friends and family and won't hesitate to call him again.,Positive
awesome he did an amazing job on my car!! promt service clean n friendly!! i sent him pics of my dent on my car and gave me an estimate and came out with no upselling or any extra bs !!! thank you so much !! highly recommend this company to anyone,Positive
"Evo showed up on time, gave me a good price and removed my dents in my 4x4 truck. He did a great job. I have a very good eye and cannot spot any dents in my truck thanks to him. He's a true professional and I would not hesitate in calling him to repair my dents in the future.",Positive
"Can't recommend this company highly enough. Evo made it so easy, from the quote to the finished product, this process was seamless. My dent was tackled with ease (mind you the VW dealership couldn't handle it as this dent was on a seam, and referred me to an auto body shop---can you say $$$$). It seemed no problem for Evo. Dent was repaired at an oh-so-reasonable price, and with craftmanship extraordinaire. My door panel is good as new with no trace of the ""injury"". I would recommend Dent Free without reserve. Thank you Evo!!",Positive
Three others were contacted (2 mobile and 1 shop) - all of whom stated that the dent was in such a location that it wasn't repairable. Turned out they were wrong either due to disinterest in taking the time to perform a quality repair or they lacked sufficient expertise. Dent Free by Evo was prompt and professional. 100% of the dent removed. No traces. A fairly deep clear-coat scratch was removed in the process. The dent was on the lower crease of the tailgate. Who knew there were honest and competent auto repair professionals in Las Vegas! Awesome. The quote was quick and scheduling was simple. Evo arrived on time and finished the job exactly as promised. You're be fortunate to find anyone better.,Positive
"Evo's a great guy, easy going, completely knowledgeable and does perfect work. If you have a dent in your car and want the best fix possible? Call Evo at Dent Free LV: 702 720-9222 All 4 thumbs UP!",Positive
"Back in August a van backed into my car and left a long, diagonal dent on the passenger side rear door. I called around to a few places, and no one was able to accommodate my schedule, except for Evo. He came to my place the next day and got the job done within an hour. That dent? Nowhere to be seen! He gets my highest praise and I recommend him to everyone.",Positive
"I buy PDR. I'm qualified, I know this industry and there are only two technicians in town at the level of Dentfree. There are over 100 technicians in Las Vegas you can spend money with and make your dent less than gone or you can call Evo. I recommend Dentfree to you. If he can't do it, you need body and paint. If someone else can't do it, give him a try. If you think he's expensive, you are setting yourself up for a craigslist tragedy.",Positive
"Professional, personable, and fair! Evo delivered when other companies said they couldn't fix the door ding on my car or gave me an estimate that was way overpriced. Very pleased with the results and he even fixed my husband's dent on his car for a reasonable price. Thank you Evo and Dent Free!",Positive
"Evo did an excellent job on my STI, fixed over 40 dents from hail damage. Great service and reasonable price. Highly recommended.",Positive
"Nothing is more aggravating to me than getting a dent in a 2 week old vehicle. My X5 suffered a door ding in the rear passenger door, with the size being larger than a quarter. Evo came highly recommended so I sent him a text message. He responded fairly quickly and set up an appointment for the following day to come to my work and take care of it. The following morning, Evo called me and said he finished up a previous job and could squeeze me in sooner if I was available. He was timely and extremely professional. His work is second to none and I was impressed that he thoroughly explained his process before starting. If you need any dents removed, Evo is your guy! Thanks a lot Evo! And my X5 appreciates you too!",Positive
I am a car dealer in town. I am overwhelmed by the professionalism of the company. Evo was able to repair dents I thought were impossible to be repaired. Highly recommended!,Positive
"DentPro of Las Vegas did a fantastic job at fixing our dents. They educated me on the process, had great customer service and did a fantastic job. I would highly recommend them to anyone!",Positive
"Without a doubt, I was amazed at how quick & Professional this Company was. Jeremy repaired a hole-type dent in my 2014 Buick LaCrosse on the rear 1/4-panel, in which it was smacked by someone who could care less for other people's property, and it was great! He made it look so simple. He repaired the hole, shined and buffed the area, and it was left like it never happened. Thank you Jeremy, Ken, CiCi and the entire business. You have made my day! I purchased this vehicle brand new, and have treated it with kid gloves. It's never been to a car wash that has those rotating brushes, rather it's been hand washed and waxed, and this is the first mishap it has gone through. Needless to say, I was pissed with what happened, but now, it not there, and I'm just so overjoyed. Thank you all. I will definitely pass on my experience with DentPro! Thank you very much",Positive
"Windy days in Vegas = dings on your car but don't worry cause these guys make everything look brand new. Just ask for Burl. I made an appointment, he called showed up the next day and within 15 minutes my car looked like it just came off the lot. Fast friendly service right to your door. He even looked the car over for additional spots to fix.",Positive
"Brandon came out to where I worked and quickly fixed my dents left by the repair shop that had worked on my car. The repair shop uses them for these very moments. He was professional, polite and very pleasant, and he took out he dents! I highly recommend Dent Pro! You will not be sorry.",Positive
I was very satisfied with my experience with Dentpro. Brandon came to my house and took out three dents on my hood and you you can't even tell was any dents there. I would recommend Dentpro amd Brandon and will use them again if I get any more dents.,Positive
Dishonest shop. Through text messaging of pics they told me my dime sized dent couldnt be fixed and that i needed to go to a bodyshop that they recommended. A bodyshop im pretty sure they own. Its ok because the dent guys las vegas already fixed this dent for me.,Negative
"I was in Las Vegas visiting a friend and borrowed her car. Well, I ended up putting a dent and some scratches on it. I heard about Dent Pro and called. I spoke to Ken, the owner, and explained to him that I was leaving Vegas to return to Naples, Florida in two days. He told me that they were super busy, but he would take care of it. Ken had someone there the next day. They fixed the dent and scratches perfectly and the cost was very reasonable. Thank you Ken and Dent Pro for taking great care of me so fast and doing such a great job.",Positive
"Contacted them regarding fixing a door ding on my rover three days later I get a call to set up an appointment. The day comes for the appointment no call, no show nothing. Customer service?lol Apparently business is so good they can afford to blow off customers.",Negative
"I attempted to make an appointment to give their service a try, after I gave them the details about the job, they advised me that Ken would call me back, well after no call, I called the office again, shortly after this, the technician finally called and gave me some sad story about his schedule and he would have call me the next day. Well he never contacted me again and with there pathetic attitude I don't plan to ever call them again, not sure how people stay in business with this professionalism. Be advised.",Negative
I called out Dentpro to fix a dent and repair some scratches on my wife's car and i was totally amazed by the quality of work. You could not even tell there was a dent and scratches. The 2 technicians did an incredible job. Both technicians were friendly and studious. And they were quick. I was 110% satisfied. I highly recommend Dentpro.,Positive
Jermey diamond came out about 2 weeks ago and did some work on my 2014 ford f-150. The dents were in the side fender in the rear above the tired. He got them out just fine. And no one can tell where the damage was at all. Wasn't thrilled with the pricing on it. But in the end you get what you pay for. I'll be keep there number. Thanks Jeremy.,Positive
Jeremy is an awesome dent Wizard! Ask for him. He removed 8 small dents from my Son's new Ford Explorer Sport. A plastic shelving unit collapsed from the heat in my garage causing the contents to fall on the vehicle. In just two hours Jeremy completely removed them all. He is neat and provides excellent service. Thank you Dent Pro of Las Vegas!,Positive
I had a nasty dent in the bumper of my BMW 650i. I was at the end of my lease and had to get it fixed fast so I didnt get hit with a big bill upon my lease return. I called Ken over at Dent Pro. He sent his guy to my office and had my car fixed in a matter of minutes. Great price on top of it all. These guys are top notch!!! Thanks Ken!!,Positive
"I was very upset when I noticed someone had ""dinged"" the passenger door my new car while I was at the market. A friend suggested I call Ken at Dent Pro. Ken was friendly and accommodating working with MY schedule. The next day a service rep. came to my office and in less than an hour my car was new again. The price is very reasonable and the workmanship beautiful.",Positive
"I visited their location on Hacienda to get an estimate and met the owner, you don't need to go to their location, they will come to you, but since I live close I did.I made an appointment to get 2 dents repaired. The dents were repaired by Billy who has seventeen years+ experience, He was prompt and courteous. When the repair was completed at my residence, I could not see where the dents used to be. I am amazed how well paint less dent repair restores the sheet metal. I did not have any paint damage from this dent so I opted to go the paint less option rather than a body shop sanding and filling in the dent, costing more money with inferior results this is my second experience with this type of dent repair and I highly recommend ""Dentpro Of Las Vegas.""",Positive
"Watch out! Dent Pro will take you for a ride! At the very least they will try to cheat you. At the suggestion of our Subaru dealer, I called them for an appointment, and met with a service rep./repair guy. The Subaru dealer told me they would charge about $40.00 to fix a very small dent on my fender. When I met the service rep., he told me it would be $200.00! Needless to say- I said no thanks, and drove off. He called my cellphone and told me to not tell anyone, but if I paid cash he would fix it for $120.00- which I ended up paying. Sounds to me like the guy earned a quick, and undeclared, bundle of cash- later, I felt a little bad, because I should not have paid him, but at the time, I was just interested in getting the job done. Oh yeah, he got the dent out in less than five minutes! No more next time for me!",Negative
"Danny and his team are amazing, I needed some custom work done and not only did it come out way way beyond my expectations but the price was way more than right. If you are the need for any custom paint for bodywork on your vehicle Cara bike or boat you have to go see Danny at devious designs You will be glad you did.",Positive
"I had an unusual request, to pinstripe my fire hydrant, with all of my dogs names on it. They not only took on my request, but did a fantastic job. They even added little doggie prints! Excellent touch. Would use Devious Designs again.",Positive
I had my classic 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass fixed at Devious Designs. All the work was done well. The color match with the rest of the car was great. Would definitely recommend Devious Designs!,Positive
"I looked all over Las Vegas to find a place that would do a quality paint job on my 1969 Camaro. Devious Designs definitely exceeded my expectations. It took a bit longer than they said it would, but it was worth it. The car looks spectacular! Communication was very good and they charged what they said they would. I would use them again. Thanks",Positive
Amazing work I wont take my cars or bikes anywhere else. They have worked on 2 of my cars 1 being a classic and they did an amazing paint work on my bike.,Positive
"Hello This guy I thought was a friend of a friends..I thought first warning sign lol..I dropped off my dodge 1500 2013 ram with suspension and front end damage.aprox 8k .I was paying cash so he allowed me to pay as we went..my truck was in his shop 5 months I paid approx 4k for suspension work..the f4ame was still bent and also needed more body work.I d3xided I wasn't coming up with money fast enough so I had it towed to my house..THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING AND FUCKED UP...when I got my truck back i was MISSING the following items.FRONT SEATS,SPARE TIRE,OIL DIPSTICK,HARNESS THAT HOLDS MY BATTERY,ALSO THERE IS A BIG ASS DENT IN MY TAILGATE about 3 inches deep a gash....He said He wasn't responsible because I didn't pick it up in time I never received 1 call..I would have definitely got it if I knew he was gonna leave it unlocked and in front of his shop for months while he had possession of keys...He did install the new seats I PAID FOR...Not sure where I'm gonna go with all this as I keep finding shit missing off my truck...Consulting an attorney as we speak",Negative
Danny and his staff were awesome! They made my car as good as new after being hit in a parking lot. Reasonable pricing and excellent work quality.,Positive
"We brought in our sons car to have some repair done to the front bumper. We were blown away of how well they fixed his car and the customer service was absolutely exceptional! Not only did they work with our insurance, the work was done in a timely matter! We've never seen a shop so clean and well kept. We could tell Devious takes pride in the work they do. If we ever need repairs done to any of our vehicles, we'll definitely take it to them!",Positive
"Had my 2012 Suzuki Hayabusa custom painted at Danny's shop! They did a great job, price was right, and the timeframe of the work was excellent. If you are looking for a custom look, I recommend stopping by for a quote!",Positive
"Danny at Devious Designs did an amazing job on my Jeep. They went above and beyond and even covered some extra work that was not in my quote. The price was more than fair, and they got the work done in 48hrs. I'd recommend them to anyone for collision damage or custom work. They are a top notch business.",Positive
Daniel and his team did a fantastic job on my 2011 Victory Vision. The costs were reasonable and the attention to detail showed in the finished work.,Positive
"Amazing work! I've never been this happy with any shop anywhere! The graphics are beyond what I was expecting and the repairs are seamless! Worth 10x what I paid! This is the second bike I've taken to them and I'll return for any car repairs or ""upgrades"" I can think of! Outstanding work! Can't wait to do my helmet to match!",Positive
"Devious Designs does the most incredible work in the entire city, by far. Each year, Danny (the owner) submits a bunch of new work to SEMA and takes trophy after trophy. He's a compassionate stand-up dude who won't rip you off, and even works with insurance companies when it comes to a wrecked custom car. Very happy to be writing this review for them, and will definitely be getting more work done here in the future.",Positive
"So I finally found a business that will paint my bike. They were awesome and walked me through the process. After spending some time looking over everything, they quoyed me a price that was at least 10% better than others and there are many examples of their work for customers to look at. I'll post more after the job is done.",Positive
"Let me start by saying that Devious Designs are TOP Notch!!! I have a custom Rigid Chopper...I had the Tank and rear Fender Painted in Exactly How I wanted it. Done Right from the Get GO!!! What makes Devious an Awesome Shop is the Customer Service. Danny (Owner) is an awesome Dude. Not only he owns the Shop, He Also Paints with the guys at the shop. Lets you know what kind of dude this guy is.... Had to do a Touch Up from a leak in my Tank and Devious Repainted it where the damage was at, Let me say that it Look like it never happened. Touch up was Exact Match to the Original Paint Theme. PRICE is FARE...for any type of work and its worth it. Great People, Awesome Work and Youll Never Regret it!",Positive
"no doubt they did wonderful custom paint job on the vehicle, but when it comes to repair they did horrible job with it. Took my car there for paint job and got back noticing two different color on the same panel, they just told me they painted half way because I looked like I was concerned about the money"", WOW, just WOW, they offered to get it look right if I pay more, and why didn't they offer this solution to me before they painted the first time? they also left all kind of overspray and white paint all over my other side panel and what's their excuse for that one? they just told me ""that's the best we can do to retouch the side panel since you decline to have the whole thing painted"" if you have repair you need to be done, and if you don't want your vehicle back worse than where you left off, I suggest you look somewhere else. Very shady business.",Negative
I wanted my car painted pink so I took my del sol to Devious. The owner Danny took the time to help me pick out my color and suggested a beautiful pink that was perfect for my car. Went above and beyond my expectations. I would recommend this shop to anyone that is looking to have their car painted or worked on. Amazing results and great customer service.,Positive
"While I'm sure this shop does awesome custom work, don't take anything there for collison or insurance work. They didn't know how total loss claims worked and also didn't do what they said they would do. It ended up with me getting less money from my claim for it being a total loss, and instead I would have tried to push for repair, but it was too late due to their lack of knowledge.",Negative
"All I can say is AWESOME JOB !! I have had a few bikes painted in my 40 years of riding, and this is by far the best so far. I have went over the finish and it is close to flawless.. The Artwork is just what the Doctor ordered. I gave Dan and Ti full color and design of project... Hit it out of the park!! Thanks and I will be returning",Positive
"I gotta say I'm trully impressed with this place. I was recommended by a friend to repair a quarter sized dent on my Harley that needed paint and slight putty. My buddy told me to see Danny (shop owner) upon walking in I was instantly greeted by him as I walked through the door. I got several quotes before I came to him, he took one look and gave me a solid price. Also said he would have it ready by Friday (this was Tuesday). Friday came around and I received a call from a gale that told me my tank was ready for pick up. Since I work Fridays she offered me to pick it up next day Saturday. There closed Saturday but she came in specifically for me so I could pick up my tank. The work came out great. Very Impressed but more impressed on the customer service how it came so naturally. Will recommend to anyone.",Positive
"A W E S O M E SHOP THI is an awesome estimated & manager .,, Dannys super nice and creative My brand new truck was tended to professionally and perfectly! Friendly & on time ;)))) Thx",Positive
"These guys did a great job painting my bike. Danny nailed it with the color, and flame design I was looking for and Thi was great on communicating the updates sending pictures of the progress. Will definitely be using them again in the near future. ....",Positive
I was so happy with everything the Devious did for me when my car had to be fixed. They made my car really look brand new! New management at Devious Designs is exceptionally better then before! I refused before but after the performance I saw with my recent visit I wouldn't go anywhere else!,Positive
"After my car was hit and run in a parking lot I spent hours looking for a reliable body shop that did quality work at an affordable price. I got numerous estimates before I decided to go with devious designs, who not only gave me the lowest quote but seemed to have an awesome portfolio. The body work looked perfect-brand new. They completed the job in a timely manner and the manager kept me in the loop throughout the process. She even emailed me pictures of my car so I could keep up with the daily progress. I highly recommend this shop.",Positive
"Devious is right. The owner is a hostile brute, corrupt & publicly humiliates his own manager, who attempted to do right by the shop warranty & the customer for failed repairs. Though there are talented techs working here, good f'N luck if you need to use Danny's Devious ""warranty"". It's worth as much as his word ... 2 dead flies at most. Had many many issues. A small area they painted & another repair they performed began to fail after less than three weeks. His staff couldn't attach a simple OEM wing properly more than 4 times. Each time the wing almost completely ripped & tore off the vehicle causing more damage & creating a poss life/death hazard for all travelers on the highway. AFTER today's failure #5 I fixed the wing myself. Thanks you A' clowns. I repaired it in less 10 minutes with a little intelligence & two part epoxy the very 1st time. Hint* Your doubled sided tape doesn't work, you'd think you'd learn that after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th time geniuses. I should've never returned after the 2nd time. But after spending near 10K at your buisness over time ... is it wrong to expect more from ""pro's""? The quarter sized area which bubbled cracked & peeled. Your manger Keith tried to honor your warranty, but you Danny (the big mouth owner) made him look like an idiot after he said he fix it under warranty, but you popped in & popped off you wouldn't approve the repair & you did this after your manger did already approved it 3 days prior for which no one let me in on the scheme. You demanded an additional charge of over $300 & that was your ""discounted price"". You're a BIG bad joke. It's not my fault you f'd the spot up prepping the vehicle. You're crooked, corrupt & dishonest any way you want to look at Danny. Karma is my response you big old rusty tool box. I took your failed work to another shop, who fixed & refused payment from me, sinced I had just paid a large amount to you, but received such utter BS. They felt you gave the whole industry a bad reputation & fixed it free as a courtesy. Guess who'll get all future buisness, other recommendations & cash tips? You're a colossal manchild & business failure. I tipped them cash as I did your shop emoloyees on multiple occasions & it was even more generous than usual. Also, like many others who reviewed your work her on Yelp, my vehicle was covered in filth throughout. So it's acceptable to return an already immaculately clean vehicle back with dirt, dust & grime from your work? The entire ventilation system was filled with grit & fine dust from the prep, repairs & paint process. By someone running the AC system it circulated & contaminated the entire vent system...clogging both the cabin air filter & engine air filter. Thanks for the dust storm when I turned in the air for weeks afterwards. It shoud'nt cost me (the customer) extra to have to clean his entire vehicle, again & replace all air filters from your shoddy work. This is professional? You offered to gouge more money from me, by offering to have your staff detail my car. Wow! You messed it up! SMH, furthermore Danny be careful & don't let your alligator mouth out run your hummingbird ass...you're a giant loud mouth bully over the phone. But, a big soft pansy once face to face with someone who doesn't have to take crap from the likes of you. Keep up that confrontional, hostile & combative mouth ""Tough guy"" & you'll someday soon you'll be eating those vile words coming from your dirty stinking mouth. Just because you drive a big vehicle don't let it go to your head that you're a big tough guy too. I spent aprox. 10K in your business & never onced met/talked with you until you began running your mouth off like a complete jerk off & threatened me over the phone. Danny you folded like a cheap lawn chair when asked you to repeat your tough talk you yelled at me over the phone when face2face. Just like all loud mouth Bullys do when actually face2face with a person who can actually shut your mouth. You cowered. Your staff are fine without you around micromanaging them, they were doing the right thing by honor the warranty. You crawled from underneath your rock & started screaming & pounding your chest, saying you'd not. You're a fraud & too ignorant to realized you shouldn't threaten customers, most of all someone who can best you on their worst day sweetheart. I opened a Yelp account just to review your BS buisness for my 1st review. Readers you've been warned. Danny you should stop being the ignorant loud A'clown towards your staff as well as, customers & the community. You'll earn all that crap back in spades. You can't produce anything so special that anyone else can't get within a 10 mile radius of your shop. You've 0 integrity. And are as fake as they come in Vegas.",Negative
"I took my car here after being referred by a trusted friend. I had to fix the front bumper to my car and some other things but couldn't go through insurance therefore had to keep the cost low. Keith took his busy time to make multiple calls to his suppliers in order to find the lowest cost. And he was very busy! I still wanted a decent looking job and expected a less than perfect fix since I was fixing on a budget. However not only did Keith explain the different options thoroughly, I found he was such a perfectionist and made my car look brand new!!! I payed $1100 where as was quoted anywhere from $1800-$2800. I ALSO got my car fixed in one day. If your looking for a fair down to earth body shop who is a perfectionist, this is your place. Thanks Keith and everyone at Devious designs!",Positive
"A special thank you to the crew at Devious Designs. Great customer service and the scallop graphics on my van came out beyond my expectations. The graphic options were first emailed to me followed up by visiting the shop for a final approval, followed by yet another email showing the final design on my van. I highly recommend Danny and his crew at Devious Designs.",Positive
"I have been going to Devious Designs for 11 years, and never had a single problem; my cars always look great when I get them back. I would never go anywhere else",Positive
Had a screw stuck in my tire. They provided cold water in 104 temps...repaired the tire and didnt charge me!!! I had intentions because I didnt buy my tires there or at any location. Thank you for the prompt quality service.,Positive
"Nice ppl here, gave us a good deal on balancing our new tires. They were very busy but they were able to get us in and out within two hours. We told them we had to change our tires on the way over because my hubby saw cracks and the place we bought it says they balanced. However when we left that place the car was vibrating and our next stop my hubby noticed none of the tires had any weights. My hubby went here to get it fixed and the guy wirking at the counter was very understanding and gave us a great deal. Our tires is now running smooth no vibration! Thank you Discount Tires!!!",Positive
They allowed me to check in and then take my car next door for an oil change and then serviced my tires! Everyone was super nice and got my needs taking care of quick!,Positive
"So impressed with the efficient and effective customer service here. Stopped by for a tire pressure check (2 days after my car was at the dealership for the full works). Air pressure was filled and the gentleman told me that one of my tires was very low and likely had a leak. He recommended I make an appointment in the next week. I called that day and made an appointment for two days later. Went today to have the tire looked at. Less than 30 minutes later, it was repaired and cost me nothing! I saw nothing short of wonderful from every employee on my visit which is something sometimes hard to come by as a woman in auto shop..... Thank you discount tire!",Positive
"Came in with a flat tire ---one of the 4 Pirelli Tires I had bought from them in Jan 2016. They said it would be 3 hours to fix. Not happy but I left the tire there and waited to be called at home. I get the call, I come over and they told me it would be one hour and a half before I the tire can be mounted. I don't get it. I had already been there so why am I waiting again? Waited and waited. Then a guy calls my name and says let's check you out at the cash register. Cash register? I thought if I bought the tires here that they are repaired for free. Instead, I was informed that they put on a brand new tire because they said the tire couldn't be fixed. Don't you think that when they called me to say ""MY tire was ready"" that they would say ""We couldn't fix the tire so we will have to put on another tire, are you ok with that mam'?"" No such conversation took place. By then, the guy who originally took care of us when we came in, Richard, stepped into the conversation. His first claim was that if he knew that we were here to get the tire mounted he would have taken us in right away. Whose fault is that? How can I assume that these guys don't talk to each other? Should I have said I will ONLY speak to Richard, can Richard come see me please? I told Richard that perhaps I didn't want to buy the tire from them if they had told me I needed a tire. How could they assume I would buy the tire from them? Richard ended up prorating the tire which means I didn't have to pay full price. AGAIN. My husband and I have been coming here for YEARS AND YEARS for all our tire needs because we were impressed with their service. Today, not so much. A waste of my day. Poor communication with the customer.",Negative
"Came here for a tire fillup. Despite being one of the smaller locations, this place gets the job done efficiently but space is an issue. The parking lot might be spacious, but the actual establishment has a sort of ""crunched"" feel to it. In other words, while you're getting your tires filled up with air, you have to deal with having your car parked against the open garages and incoming traffic. Since the lot is shared with Krispy Kreme and a Jiffy Lube, you get shared car traffic from both businesses. Still, somehow they get the job done, so credit needs to be given where credit is due.",Positive
"It pains me to do this because from what I understand, Discount Tire prides itself on being a reputable company that prizes their brand and customer loyalty. I've personally been a customer in the past and always felt they had a sterling, honest reputation and admirable business model. A bad experience recently has shattered my faith in them completely. A little background- I leased my 2016 model year vehicle in July of 2015. It has approximately 16000 miles on it. I brought my car to Discount Tire a few weeks ago because the tire pressure light came on. I figured they just needed air. The guy who helped me took a look at my two front tires and in an alarmist manner proceeded to tell me that the tire tread on my front two tires was so bad, it was bordering on ""dangerous"" to drive on them. He informed me I needed to replace them both ""as soon as possible"". Obviously, this freaked me out. Why would the tread be this worn on what was essentially a new car? Had the dealership leased me a car with ""lemon"" tires? Also, having just bought a new tire ($280!!) at the dealership five months ago (I ran over a nail), I knew my 19inch model tire wasn't sold at Discount and I'd have to spend almost $600 at the dealership to replace them both!!! The stress resulting from this interaction was REAL ya'll. So I took my car to the dealership last weekend and relayed to them what the guy at Discount Tire told me. They promised me they would do a thorough check. Well imagine my shock to find out, the tires are in PRISTINE condition. I was LIED TO at Discount Tire! Blatantly so. And this came from a woman in my dealership's service department. I trust her FAR more than I trust any ""dude"" trying to pull a fast one on me to sell some tires. She laughed and wondered why they would tell someone with a new car such an easily disprovable lie! What a shame. I will sincerely never do business here again and I urge others to take their advice with a grain of salt and get second opinions elsewhere- even if it costs you more money. This one awful experience has tainted their reputation for me. I wish I remembered the name of the guy who ""helped me"" so I could post it here. I'm kicking myself for not recalling, but the news of needing $600 worth of tires on a new car was just so distressing at the time, I blanked. A parting word for any shady Discount Tire employees who happen to read this: before you choose to bark on such a grand deception- look at the odometer first and ask yourself- does it make SENSE for me to tell a customer with 16,000 miles on a new car that their tread is ""dangerously"" worn? Also maybe check to see if the tires are ones YOU EVEN SELL because otherwise, WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE LIE? Even if this cockamamie story was accurate, you don't sell the tires on my car so it gains you nothing to freak me out this way! And I'm especially offended as a woman because this experience further solidifies the stereotype that men in auto servicing LIE to unknowing, vulnerable women. Shame on you Discount Tire. Seriously.",Negative
"The unfortunate circumstance of a flat tire brought me here. I came in not in a great mood, because, well... who enjoys getting a flat tire? Oh, and I forgot to mention my husband and I are driving across the country to move to Minnesota... TODAY. So my stress level was through the roof. I was promptly helped when I arrived, and everything was explained to me very thoroughly. Everyone I talked to was very convivial and kind, which helped dissipate my bad mood. This location has exceptional customer service. I would highly recommended!",Positive
My boyfriend had to go in to get a new set of tires because one had blown on a car we had recently purchased from a private seller. He ended up having to spend most of the day at the shop. He was working with Sergio who let him know about an offer for free rims if you financed 4 tires. When he brought the car home we decided we really didn't like the rims that we selected and called to see if we could have them switched out for a different rim. Sergio told us yes but that it would be an upcharge but he'd give us a discount. When we got back there he said he would take care of us and had the car finished in under an hour! He was so helpful that we are for sure going to continue visiting him at the Scottsdale location even though we are all the way in Gilbert!,Positive
Great customer service!! Serviced my wife's car on warranty claims for Bridgestone tires. Helped us tremendously on warranty claims and with (2) new tires to get out from underneath the Bridgestone separation issues. Always friendly and helpful! I like this location!,Positive
"A great group of staff . Thank you for the prompt and efficient service . Not to mention the credit and additional discounts for being a loyal client .. I can only say how relieved I am to have my ""feet"" maintained by these guys as our tires are like our ""shoes"" and I'm a ""mobile"" biz as well so thank you !!!! HairDoc Tk",Positive
"Went in to ask if they had nitrogen, the guy working quickly gave me a sarcastic ""no, but air is 70% nitrogen. Soo"" while rolling his eyes. Not the first time they've talked down to me had a tire replaced 5 months ago (due to road hazard puncturing it) and they wanted to tell me my 2016 HRV would new tires soon because of the tread ware (you can still see the vent spews on them). Bad customer service-rude condescending employees. I know I'm a female but I've been in the auto industry for 5 years. I would not recommend going here unless you enjoy arguing with staff.",Negative
"The Manager Bill and his team are the best in town. Always smiling, accommodating and most important honest. I went in after tearing a little piece of my tire on a sidewalk. Husband in the car... NOT HAPPY. We thought the tire needed to be replaced and after Bill inspected it, it turned out it was just cosmetic and safe to drive still. That's the best service you can get. We have been loyal customers for 7 years and again never disappointed. Don't look further: they are AWESOME! Ps: if needed, make an appointment, you will skip the line.",Positive
Manager Bill is friendly and his staff is fast and efficient! Will definitely be back for all my tire needs! Thanks Bill,Positive
"Been coming here for years. Super friendly, and helpful people who work here. If you book an appointment to rotate tires it takes about an hour and you are done. If you buy your tires with them get the insurance. ..it pays for itself with the first flat!",Positive
"Great customer service! I stopped-in - just to get air in my tires - and a worker came out to my car, inspected my tires, and told me that I should consider getting one of them replaced. He didn't pressure me at all. When I drove my car around to get air, that worker also did the same thing. Again, I didn't feel pressured at all. So, rather then have a problem on a freeway sooner than later, I chose to replace the tire while I was there. The guys got my car in and out quickly and were all very friendly.",Positive
"Went in today because my tire kept going flat. I had purchased many times from this location and they have always been great. This time was exceptional. They promptly greeted me and took my car in for inspection. It was done in about 25 minutes and was no charge due to the tires having a warranty from them. I am not sure if it would have been free otherwise, but another discount tire location fixed my tire for free once when something happened to my factory tires that came from the dealership. Overall a great, fast experience!",Positive
Great experience here with a speedy tire rotation!! Manager today also got everyone in the waiting room bottled water. Thanks for getting me in and out to pick up my daughter on time. Been coming here for years! Thank You!!!,Positive
"I came here to purchase new tires before turning my leased car back into the dealership. I wanted to spend as LITTLE as possible considering I personally would only be driving all of a couple miles on the tires. I scheduled an appointment and arrived on time. I met with Sergio who was super stoked to hear I needed to buy a set of tires. Again I mentioned I wanted to do this as CHEAP as possible. He continued to try to upsell me...to the extent of putting a flipping warranty on the tires. DID I NOT JUST SAY IM TURNING THE CAR IN TOMORROW? After explaining to him for a third time that I wanted the cheapest tire in the joint, he charged my card and had me take a seat. 30 minutes Into my ""appointment time"" my vehicle is still sitting in the parking lot. Super annoyed and will NEVER be coming back.",Negative
HORRIBLE. Bought new wheels from Discount Tire and two days later my tire and fell off going 70mph on I17! Bill the store manager didn't do anything. Never called me back! They messed up three times in my transaction and now the tire fell off and cost me over $300! They will not reimburse any of the damages and refuse to even talk to me!,Negative
"I was about to get new tires but this store would put the new tires on because 3 of the rims had a tiny crack on them. So they made it feel like had to get new rims & tires no matter what. I talked to their manager Bill the next day, he wasn't understanding at all. He said I could've just walked away and drove home with my damaged rims. I wish that they were more clear on what my options were. And when I asked about their return policy, he told me he can only give me half credit back for the new rims. My advice, just be aware of what your options are and don't get suckered by them on having to spend more money.",Negative
Crazy that I feel a tire shop has the Best customer service! The prices are comparable but I have found some better deals at Costco sometimes.,Positive
Excellent service. Very knowledgable and friendly. I would def come back again or recommend them to others. Thanks discount!,Positive
"They had me in-n-out in no time. Got a flat tire in Arizona and needed to get my tire patched, was greeted at the door with water and great customer service. They were unable to repair the tire and sold me a new replacement pro-rated.",Positive
These guys were very friendly and professional when I went to get tires today. They had me in and out in less than an hour. I will definitely be telling everyone about them. :),Positive
"The first time I came to this place was in 2002 right after I moved to AZ. I had a nail in my tire and needed it to be repaired. Twenty minutes latter my tire was fixed and I was on my way, all at no charge! The tires were not from there even... Ever since then, I have been getting my tires from them. Their prices are good and service is the best!",Positive
"My left front tire looked a little low, so I stopped by to have them check it. It was right at 6:00 PM and the sign on the door said they closed at 6:00. I went in and the guy behind the counter asked what I needed and he went out and checked all four tires. He recommended we add a little air. He did that. He did not ask if I had bought my tires there, which I actually had, or if I was already a customer. Great customer service. This is why I will always go to Discount Tire. Their employees understand how to take care of customers and keep them coming back. Excellent job! Ken Jackson",Positive
"This is several miles from where I live - but there are a number of ""tire"" shops within a half a mile of me. When I went out to my car after being away for awhile - I had a flat tire. After AAA came out and put my spare on, I went to 3 different tire shops - two who wouldn't even look at it because they ""don't repair flats"". WTF - a tire store that doesn't repair tires!! The last one I went to suggested Discount Tire, so off I went, expecting the worse. What a great surprise!! They got the tire, looked at it, and showed me where there was a hole in the sidewall, which couldn't be fixed. So I bought I new tire, it was on the car and out in 30 minutes. Great service, fast, and really reasonable prices. Just this month, the wheels and tires were stolen off of my son's Yukon. I suggested Discount Tires, and they came to the car and replaced them, all within a day. And they had to deal with the insurance, and also special order the wheels and tires. With that kind of service they are now my tire store!!!",Positive
"My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat. We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new). They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning. They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable. Absolutely great service! I highly recommend them.",Positive
"Thank you! Troy Alsobrook you are amazing. On the way to an important meeting this afternoon and ended up with a flat tire...flat as can be. Had the spare put on and headed to my next appointment. Saw this location for Discount Tires and I drove in at 5:40. They close at 6:00 but Troy took care of me right away, found the tire in their inventory and got it taken care of right away. I have been using Discount Tires for a long time since 1999 in Atlanta and now in Scottsdale. Every location is great, but I gotta say that Troy was fabulous. He saw my distress and concern - the tires on my car are not cheap - found me in the system and my policy covered me with just the new insurance and indicator rebuild. He had the car in and out in less time than it took me to call for the road service. Thank you thank you to Troy and his staff.",Positive
"This was my second time getting tires at this location, but first time in over 8 years. I had been a loyal Firestone customer till I a couple bad experiences ""drove"" me away! My Infiniti Q40 got a nail in the rear tire, and being down to the minimum tread on the OEM tires, I opted to start shopping for a new set. I had narrowed my purchasing locations to NTB, Sam's Club Tires, and Discount Tire. Sam's Club reviews steered me to an NTB, but they failed to have the tires in-stock that I was told were there on the phone. I spoke with Discount Tire and arranged to get the Specific Continental Extreme Contacts I had researched for my car setup to be installed the next morning to get a promo they had running. I dropped the car off as they opened, and mentioned a reason for me not going back to Firestone was that they gouged the rims on my last car, and not to get these scratched - we went and verified the condition of my rims and I headed to work. My car was finished LONG before I needed it ready, and was able to quickly pick it up. I was disappointed to see my rims gouged, by unlike Firestone, they handled it immediately and beyond my satisfaction. I was not looking for money, so they arranged to have the scratches removed. The tires handle great, the install cost was in line with everyone - no additional fees were snuck in, and the customer service was excellent. Things happen - it's how they are handled that is the real importance, and this location did a great job.",Positive
Been going here for new tires and the occasional repair for 10 years. They've almost always did fine. Friendly and professional. Lobby has coffee and Good WiFi.,Positive
Came in to get my tire replaced and Clayton was very helpful! Very fast service and friendly staff. Will definitely be back for all my tire needs.,Positive
"They are super friendly, fast, and give you their best and honest opinion on what tires you should get for your car. I live in the mountains and they advised me with some great tires. When it snowed, there was great traction and good braking. I am very content with my tires and the service they have provided. I highly recommend them. The only thing that is a downfall, is that they do not do alignments, which is super important for the tires and a tire provider. It makes it a hassle having to go to another place and pay extra. Other than that, everything is great.",Positive
"Found out I had a huge nail in my tire, went to get it patched at the Discount Tire on S. Tryon. Immediately greeted by Frank once I walked in the store, told him I needed my tire patched. Had no clue that ALL of my tires were bald (I only know about making sure my oil changes are up to date and putting gas in my car). Frank gave me the best deal on 4 brand new tires and his customer service was above reproach. Definitely gained a lifetime customer! Thanks Frank!",Positive
"Friendly, fast, hassle free service. I was in an out in 45 minutes. They have plenty of people and get it done. Best experience I've had doing this. Good job! Prices are good overall too.",Positive
Kudos to Frank as he went above and beyond to satisfy my tire needs today. He exemplifies integrity as stated on the wall sign - thanks again Wayne and Frank! I recommend this shop and will bring them back my business. Keep up the good work guys.,Positive
"I had a great experience at Discount Tire! I ordered my new tires online - which was super helpful. They tell you what tires fit your car and additionally provide ratings for each with reviews, so you know exactly what you are getting. After ordering, I called to follow up and schedule my appointment. They got me in right away and were super helpful to work around my work schedule. Once they began working on my car, they realized there was an issue with one of the tires they were installing, so instead of adjusting my bill to put a different tire on, THEY UPGRADED ME FOR FREE!! They installed a better rated tire which came with a better warranty than my original choice.",Positive
"""Free"" tire repair means they'll tell you they can't repair it. When they see you drive up in an AwD Audi, they know if you have to replace 1 tire, you have to get 4. Went to a different shop, $16 to repair the screw puncture. Quite sad seeing that I've spent over $2000 on tires at DT and they just lost a client for life. You just don't flat out lie to a person.",Negative
Everyone was very professional at this location. I needed a new tire on my Civic do to a screw. I was told about an hour for everything to be done. I was in and out within an hour and they were busy! Great service.,Positive
"Hands down the best tire experience I've had. Lots of places forget that customers are dropping a lot of money and the customer experience suffers. This place was on point. Jesse did a great job at the front desk helping me understand pricing and what options were available to me. He let me know if I went with Discount Tire I'd be out of the store in 45 minutes. I laughed at him and told him he was on the clock. I chose my tires based on price, not performance. About 5 minutes after I selected the set of tires Matthew from the shop came out and sat down with me. He was not pushy, but very informative on a set of performance tires he recommended for my BMW. I asked several questions and he was up front and honest. He shared with me several in house and mail in rebates that made the performance option only $40 more than the economy set. All in all, this experience left me thinking I'll be a customer of Discount Tire for life -Wesley",Positive
Very busy store. If you are in a hurry think twice. I had to wait for an hour to get my tire repaired from a nail puncture! On a Thursday morning. Very nice people though.,Positive
"Awesome place! Called because I was concerned I had a flat tire. Gentleman on the phone was welcoming and pleasant and said inspections and sealing it safely would be free, said to come on out! So I did and they checked it and were so honest! Said only thing wrong was some dirt between the wheel and the tire. In and out quickly! Super professional and great friendly staff! I'm getting my next set of tires here!!!",Positive
"Matthew has been super helpful. I got a piece of metal stuck in my tire so my husband and I brought my car here bc they are right around the corner from our apartment. My tires generally run a little high, about $290....Matthew found me a full set of tires for my car that only cost me $625 which includes a milage and hazard warranty on them! Also bc I am interested in changing out my rims he took the time to research and find me an awesome deal on the Konig Crowns I wanted. I really appreciate him taking the time to help us out and get us a great price on tires and rims.",Positive
"Brought my car in right when they opened for a tire rotation. Gentleman who took my information was nice, and quoted me 35 minutes as there were 2 people in front of me. I waited in the waiting room for a good 45 minutes and started seeing other cars completed who were in after me; nobody had said anything was going on. Waiting outside their doors as well and saw my car still with some wheels being taken off. Still nobody came to find me or tell me anything was wrong. Finally after about an hour my car was pulling out and I asked how 35 minutes turned into nearly an hour. That gentleman claimed he came to look for me to tell me a wheel was bent and they had a harder time getting it balanced. NOBODY ever called my name in the waiting area or right out the door. Would've been nice to know what was going on when it took place as I could understand the delay at that time. Nothing special about this place, was just OK for the purpose of a tire rotation.",Positive
"I cannot sing the praises of this particular Discount Tire location enough!! I came in last Friday needing 4 new tires on my car and already had some in mind. When I arrived, I chatted with Alex who asked me a little about how I typically drive. He was able to suggest a better tire for the same price (after rebate) and never tried to oversell me! The crew was then able to get me in, out and on my way quickly. Unfortunately I banged up my wheels worse than they already were and noticed leaking. I brought my car back in and, again, Alex was able to work with me to find an UNBELIEVABLE deal on new wheels!! He, along with the rest of the staff, treat you like a human being and with the compassion that most customer service reps no longer find important. Not once did I feel as if I was just another customer or that my business was not appreciated. Honestly, I felt as if they had nothing by my ultimate safety in mind! I will not stop telling anybody who will listen how amazing these guys are!! They have truly ensured I will be a customer for life!!",Positive
"Great service and a very nice facility. They got me right in and they fixed my tire that was leaking air every week for free. I'll be back. They were very profession, I was very impressed.",Positive
Best place to get tires in Charlotte!!Quick and professional everytime and I have been coming here for over 5 years at least.They will also meet others prices if lower!,Positive
"I bought a car after my last one caught fire over a year ago (Yep. That happened. In a grocery store parking lot. I wasn't in it. Whew... lol)... Anyway, the only thing that has been bothering me about this new ride is the tires... Luckily this place isn't far from my place... Apparently I ended up with two nails in one tire and one in another... Not to worry, though! They repair tires and fill them up with air with no appointment... For free... And it doesn't take a thousand years, either... Mike, Seneca and Adrian are fabulous... I've run into them a lot more than the other guys and they are a dream... The other issue I've had? A tire blowout... It was awesome! On the highway at 5:30 in the morning, alone, with no cell phone... Luckily, I was near my office and no one was hurt... YES! After I had my fantastic tow guy (His name's Corey with 24-Hour Towing... He is also the best... Call him anytime and he's there...) drop me off with my vehicle, they found that my tires had wheel locks on them... Know what they are? I didn't! lol These special kind of lug nuts that require a key to get them off... Did the place I bought my car from give me the key? Or tell me they were on there? Nope! So they ended up having to strip the lug nuts, so they could put the new tire on for me... They gave me places to go to buy a new wheel key for my old tires and gave me a really decent price on a tire... And it STILL took less than 2 hours! I've waited longer for an oil change... Fabulous... My favorite thing about this place, though? They tell you what you need... NOT what they want you to buy, what you actually need... They don't go for the hard upsell, they don't try to slide things by you and as a lady that often takes my car in for service, I definitely appreciate that...",Positive
"I had a flat tire before work so I put the spare on and saw the huge screw in my tire. I took it into Discount Tire to see if they could hopefully patch it and if not sell me a replacement. Not only were they able to patch it and remount the tire, but they did it for free despite not having bought the tires from there in the first place. I was in and out within 20 minutes. Best experience I've ever had at the tire shop and some of the nicest guys I've ever met.",Positive
"These guys are all awesome!! I have bad luck with nails so i visit here often. They never make me feel like some dumb chick because I don't know anything about cars, and everything I've ever had done here was free. They don't try to convince me that something's wrong with my car/tires, they just get the job done & quickly!",Positive
"I was so impressed by how professional and friendly these guys were. They were great with my husband but I was worried being a woman that they would try to take advantage and make me buy things I don't need. They were quick, charged me very fairly, and were perfect gentlemen :)",Positive
"Driving home last week, one of my tires decided that it wasn't happy with being round anymore and it wanted to spend more time playing golf. A flat. I managed to get the donut on and got to Discount Tire the next morning. The staff were quite friendly and very knowledgeable. No problems at all with the explanation of how much it would cost and how long it would take. I walked down to the nearby shopping plaza for lunch and when I returned, they were just pulling my car out of the garage. The only reason I couldn't give it that magic fifth star was that I realized later that they never offered me any choice in the replacement tire. I might have wanted something just a little less expensive. On the plus side, he did offer me their road hazard coverage not just on the tire I purchased, but also on the other three that were still okay on the car. And he gave me a slight discount when I twitched at the $162 bill.",Positive
"It is very uncommon for me to blown away by someone doing what they say they will do but doing it faster, better, and cheaper than first quoted. This place is awesome, the staff is excellent, I scheduled an appointment, arrived 10 minutes early and I was gone in 40 minutes. As far as car maintenance goes that's a friggin' land-speed record. I cannot remember the guy who specifically helped me out but from what I recall everyone was friendly. There was an odd fellow in the waiting room who kept ranting to me about how good the tire pressure gauges were and how he couldn't believe they were only $2 and that I'd be a moron if I didn't pick one up.. I didn't pick one up, I just kept playing Angry Birds until my tire was changed.",Positive
"I had been dealing with Discount Tires for years in Las Vegas, but just recently moved to Charlotte. Earlier this year was having some work done at Firestone and they noticed a nail in my tire & charged me $30 to fix. Stopped in at Discount Tire today to find out about a tire repair & ""woopie"" it's free. Repaired my tire, checked & added air in other tires. Almost no wait. I will be going back.",Positive
"This place was recommended to me by a co-worker. I went in today and was able to get all 4 tires (80,000 mile warranty) plus free tire lifetime rotations every 6,000 miles and a $20 discount on each tire ( I asked if he could help me out since I got 4 instead of 2) Very friendly efficient service - as I was in and out in 20 min. As they explained it, puncture a tire within 80,000 miles then get a free one replaced no questions asked. The customer next to me smiled and said ""I can vouch for that!"" It's certainly nice having peace of mine - at not too shabby of a price!",Positive
"m 49 yrs old and I have purchased a lot of cars over the years. I have to say this has been absolutely the worst experience I have ever had or could imagine . After looking for 6 weeks I finally settle on a Ford Edge, I put down $1000 and was taking the rest out of a retirement account for the down payment that takes 2 weeks to complete . I call several times to make sure everything is good to go as well as email, I set up full coverage ins and show up at 9 am sharp to finish the deal . Dave pulls my file and says oh your here for the Dodge Ram, I'm like no, Ford Edge, I wanted to see the car again before I finished the deal . To my surprise it's no where to be found . THEY SOLD IT !! I now have no car and insurance on a car that someone else is driving, I got no explanation, no apology . No anything . I would strongly suggest you save your time and headaches, what a disaster of a dealership . The manager Adam Cox couldn't care less. He has never once apologized and after i called his Corp office twice he told her he wasn't going to anything for me and didn't care and he is the GM. What a joke this guy is . Good luck",Negative
WORSE CAR EVER! I got a lease through them. When I initially test drove the car it drove horrible. The steering handling was loose and off and the brakes were horrible. After I had them fix those issue there was an issue with the tires. Now a month later I am having issues with the tire monitor and the headlights. They DO NOT make sure that their cars are in good condition before selling them and that leaves the consumer in a horrible position. I am now having to come out of pocket for repairs that I shouldn't have this soon into my lease. I WOULD NOT recommend this company. The ONLY positive thing about my experience is knowing that it's a lease and I can take it back at any time.... And I plan to return this car asap!,Negative
I don't have the car any more. But the company itself is awful. They sold me a HORRIBLE car. It leaked really bad. So I constantly had mildew in my car. And that is a small issue. Drive Time has EXTREMELY high finance rates and will rob you. No one wanted to help me solve my problem in the year I has the car. Then after 2 weeks of getting rid of the car someone calls to see how I am and if I am enjoying the car. Mind you i haven't heard from ANYONE in over a year. I will never refer anyone one to this company. Beware.,Negative
"Waste of time, don't fall for the online approval, just a ploy to get you there and put you in some lemon.... they gave me a 30k approval online to only offer me a car for under 11k",Negative
"Please be aware of the deals in Drive Time 7301 South Blvd Charlotte NC 28273. I decided to purchase & had blocked a Toyota 2010 Corolla with $200 as Hold Amount on 1st May 2015 at around 2 pm. The sales man was very friendly (Matthew Long) & their manager (John) agreed that the car is on hold until I return. I reached the Dealer on 2nd May at 6.00PM to pay the cheque & move forward with the purchase where in I was told an unacceptable response that the car was sold the previous night. The Dealer were not courteous to give me at least a call that the car is not available. I even tried reaching them in the noon at 3.00 PM on 2nd May & did not get any update even then. These people are cunning & do not care for customer commitments. They falsely said that the car is sold & was not updated in their inventory when they showed me for the first time. I am feeling lucky that I did not go ahead with the car purchase as the dealer is not good in their intentions, Be Careful!! Do not visit or think twice before getting on a deal with Drive Time south Boulevard Charlotte,",Negative
"After going to several other shady dealerships I decided to check out Drive Time's new lease option for people with shakey credit. I experienced GREAT customer service from Mia, Paul and Mark at the South Blvd location. I didn't feel pressured or have to pay a large down payment. Speaking of payments.....my monthly payment is very affordable and I am able to have it automatically withdrawn from my account! All in alll this was the BEST car purchasing experience I have ever had!",Positive
"I was in desperate need of a car, and fast! I didn't really think that I would be able to afford anything from a dealer (and hadn't been approved at a couple already), but I had gotten to the point where I thought, ""What could it hurt?"" My mom and I went in to Drivetime on South Blvd and were instantly greeted by James and Garret, then they introduced us to everyone else that was there. It really made me feel welcome and comfortable, right from the start. James sat down with us and got all my information, we discussed what I was looking for, and then we went to look at a couple of options that Seth (the owner) had pulled for me. I loved the first one they showed me, but didn't think I could possibly afford it... But they made it happen. I got a great car, with a warranty, at a reasonable price and payments that I will be able to afford -- the same day! The next day, I got a call from the dealership while I was at work. When I saw the number, I thought, ""Oh no, something went wrong and I'm going to have to bring the car back."" But no, it was another employee who hadn't been there when I was and she just wanted to ""introduce"" herself and let me know there was yet another person there that was ready and willing to help me with anything I needed... Definitely not the vibe I'd gotten at some other dealerships. It was an amazing experience and I would definitely recommend Drivetime to anyone!",Positive
The salesmen at DriveTime are the best. This is my 2nd car that we have purchased through them and it was easy. I have recommended them to my friends and family. Car buying here is not like any where else. Give them a try.,Positive
"Here's my nightmare. I'm on my third vehicle after the first two had major mechanical issues. Returned both of them now the third vehicle is being picked up from the repair shop as I type this since the claim for serious issues that had to present when the vehicle was sold was denied by silver rock warranty. First fuel pump 6 days after this one, then break issues within a month, now fuel injection and spark plug problems, etc. Costing me $50 for a diagnostic when I could have took this lemon to my own mechanic for it for free. Might add all this has taken place in less than four months. I'm not the only customer being robbed with shady practices. But I know once this gets out others will come forward and as with all other companies before truths will be revealed. Starting with denying claims on vehicles with potentially death causing issues on a car customers took possession of within days. Also all fluids in this 2014 Nissan Altima purchased with 39k miles are dark and dirty making me question about this so called multi point inspection. Three cars off the same lot with major issues within two weeks.",Negative
"Found a car on Autotrader, made an appointment to see it. He begun by viewing my US income info. I have 680 credit score at the moment. For some strange reason that we sincerely dont understand, the seller all of a sudden said ""this is one of our speciality vehicles so we can only finance it if you have $4000 monthly US income or more"" (he already knew my US income is just below that). When asked what a speciality vehicle was, they responded ""more equipment and has a 7 in the number"". So driving all the way out to the east LV ghettos was a waste of our time. So dont believe their statement ""we work with all types of credit"". They are liars pure and simple. My home is paid off and I have $60000 worldwide income but I am still not good enough for Drivetime.",Negative
"So if I read the yelp reviews prior to coming in, I might not have decided to get my car from here. I came to drive time after going to a few other dealerships like Toyota, Nissan and CarMax but due to some credit issues, they offered my extremely high interest on used cars with payments close to $500. Drive time was my last resort before I gave up on getting a car. I came in on Friday afternoon just to look around and see what my options were. I ended up working with Toby and he was professional, patient and answered all questions I had. I told him I prefer a Honda Civic or maybe a VW Jetta. I have had two other Honda Civics and they are truly safe and reliable cars. I was shown a cute Acura but it had leather seats and it was very hot that day so sitting inside the car let me know, leather seats are not for me. The second car he shown me was a 2016 Honda Civic EX. The car was exactly what I wanted! It comes with more than what I thought I wanted and also the payment was much smaller than anything I was offered at other dealerships. Also, my interest rate offered by Drive time was almost 10% lower than other offers. The problem with the other dealer offers was that the car they told me I could get was NOT worth the high payment they wanted. The Civic I purchased from Drive Time a few days ago has remote start and that alone sold me because being pregnant in this summer heat, being able to cool my car before getting in it Is a true benefit. I mean, I have had no problems with my car so far and it drives very smooth and was not high mileage, 30,560 was what the odometer read. I personally am glad I gave this place a try and have told a few people I know about it. Also, yes I did put money down. I was approved for a $400 down payment but since I wanted lower monthly payments and I was getting a settlement from a car accident in my 2006 Civic Hybrid, I decided to be much more down. All in all, I had a good experience. Probably the least stressful car buying experience I have ever had buying a car. Toby did not hassle me or push me toward buying anything. He was accommodating and helped me get a deal that was in my price range.",Positive
I would not recommend anyone to DriveTime. Their vehicles have high miles and are in extremely bad condition. Do not let the outside appearance fool you. You will begin to have problems almost immediately or after your warranty expires. If they send you to one of their Vendors watch out AAMCO does not do a proper repair and their parts are defective. DriveTime is not a second chance it is a death sentence.,Negative
Save yourselves from a bad experiance with this company. I have had to deal with them since july of 2017. When i first took it to repair it they were nice but after that it went down hill. One thing after another. The warrenty wont cover but then it does. Its just disgusting how they want you to waste more then what the car is actually worth. But yet they want you to keep making your payments on time. Its terrible what they do and disgusting that they dont want to help. Dont buy from dive time go to some one else. And denise from customer relations is a lair,Negative
"So our adventure started on October 20th of 2017, that's when we encountered the worst dealership in Las Vegas. She (my girl) purchased a 2012 Chevy Traverse, after 5 days the check engine light comes on, car is taken in and fixed, 2 days after she got it back the light comes on again and it has to be towed in again, in the shop for 4 days then last week on Saturday it breaks down again, we contact Bridgecrest/DriveTime and they won't stand behind their vehicles, she calls to deferred one payment and they start making threatening calls to me. They claim no record of a payment arrangement being made at all which was garbage. I tried to warn her because where I work we have to deal with them and we know they are garbage, not only that nightmare, when DriveTime purchased the vehicle from another dealership they paid 10,000 dollars but marked it up to 15,965 and after ridiculous finance charges to make this vehicle about 30,000 out the door with 98,000 miles on it, any used vehicle in the state of Nevada by law over 75,000 miles they must make available the engine and drive Train inspection which they did not. So basically horrible sales staff horrible customer service reps, and if you give them a negative review on Facebook they block you from the page.",Negative
"This is the second time I have had a bad experience with Drive Time. The first time the car was inoperable within 60 days of purchase due to motor mounts that were not covered under the warranty. So I lost out on my down payment and vehicle. This time one week after obtaining the car I found out the rim was damaged and causing the tire to loose presure rapidly. I could have lost my life driving both faulty vehicles. I understand these are used cars, but these issues are life threatning. I stronlgy caution anyone when purchasing a vehicle from Drive Time! An the intrest is absurb.",Negative

Never ever buy a car from this company they don't report to the credit bureau if you paid off a car and they fight with you over the phone. All cars have very high mileage warranty sucks,Negative
"Do yourself a favor and do NOT give drivetime your number. After I did some digging and found out about the shady business practices, I decided to stay far, far away from the company. Unfortunately, by that point, the company already had my number, and Lisa at this location has been calling my phone each day for over a month. You'd think at some point she would take a hint, but obviously not.",Negative

Guess what again my car doesn't turned on it was send for repair and same shit drive time sucks.!!!!",Negative
"We bought a car there four years ago and they blew through the paperwork and we signed up. We are going to pay the full value of a new explorer instead of one with 100k on it. My wife did have challenges on her credit, but they too advantage of her on a big way. Her challenge was due to a credit repair company shenanigans. Don't ever buy from drive time. We are almost done with them and they are trying to trick her into buying again. With 700 + credit scores now, we don't think we will be doing business with them again. Don't shop here. They are predators. They suck.",Negative
Aszia was such a great help and was very easy to work with. It was an all day process but worth it. She went above and beyond to help me get into the car I was needing and I appreciate her.

"I have put off in putting in a review till I've had a chance to drive the car for a bit. I picked a 2009 toyota avalon with 68k miles. Unlike some people, I did my due diligence and inspected the car, drove the car, made sure all panels were properly aligned. As improper alignment is a sign of poor workmanship after repairs from an accident. During the test drive I checked for proper wheel alignment, squeaking, rattles or vibrations. I checked the condition of the inside, outside, wipers, tires ect. After 2000 miles and a trip to California, no problems at all. Runs like new with new tires and outside few cosmetic issues no complaints here. People need to do the due diligence and check the vehicle for themselves. You are not getting new cars and just can't assume the dealer fixed the issues or dealer will fix any future problem. Overall I don't feel like I got ripped off, I knew going it I will get a bad interest rate. Everything was told to me up front and was allowed to test drive multiple vehicles without pressure to pick one.",Positive
This is my third car with DriveTime. Why is it my third? Every car I've have from them was terrible so I traded them in within the 5 days. Now not to mention I am 6 months pregnant so I really need to get around. When I first got the 3rd car Ivan the store mananger promised me all kinds of things that would be fixed through warranty. I called warranty because every time I came outside to go to work my tires were flat. Yes FLAT!! SO the warranty says okay they will approve it even though it's something they usually don't. Okay good so I call the warranty and they say they are waiting for Drive time a customer relations to approve my tires. I call customer relations which is horrible!!! And they say nope we aren't fixing anything literally that's what the man says. Now my tired are only okay if I put fix a flat in them which is not a good thing. Remember I'm pregnant right? So my tired could just fall off at anythime. I don't think its fair and I don't think I should have to replace the tires of I've been TOLD they would be approved because I've had solo many issues. Smh. I have called the Better Business Beraue and a lawyer to handle it because its been that bad. I would never recommend going here ever to anyone. I'm going to let everyone I know not to go there.,Negative
If I could give negative stars I would. Terrible dealership and over all company. My girlfriend purchased a vehicle with them last year. Put down the required down payment and made payments on time for half a year. After a perfect payment history she missed her payment date by 3 days and without notification they repo'd the car! No phone call no mail NOTHING! We thought it was stolen and called the police only to find out it was repo'd. and only after 3 days late. What kind of customer service it this? then we call to see what we can do and they want to charge us a 600 fee plus the payment to get the car back. told us we have 48 hours. we said screw the car and this company. when she went to pick up the things she left in the car IT WAS ALREADY SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE. SO WITHIN THE 12 HOURS THEY REPO'D IT THEY ILLEGALLY SOLD IT. So if you are considering buying a car here id recommend saving yourself from these crooks.,Negative
"Just remember: it's a used car dealer who deals in helping people w poor credit get a car. It is what it is. Don't expect a Benz when you can't afford one. That being said: This Drivetime dealer has been nothing but wonderful to me for well over a year. They were there to help me get a car for work and life when no one else would, and they never made me feel guilty about it. The moment I walked in, I knew I was welcome. It took about 2 whole minutes on a busy afternoon to get one on one service. They supplied computers and printers to get all the paperwork going (pay stubs, credit reports, bank statements, etc), and were very patient w me as a fairly inexperienced car buyer. They were informative as well, and walked me through both the purchasing program and the cancel anytime lease program. Transparency was apparent. I chose the lease, and was lucky enough to find multiple cars on the lot, which is quite large, that I was qualified for. The finance process was simple and took about an hour to complete. I met Joe there, and he was awesome. He made me feel like family, and was very straight forward about the finance terms and the pro's and con's of the two options. He also helped me to understand how to earn credit toward future down payments w the purchase program by using auto-pay, and helped me get set up with new car insurance. I made payments on the car for about 14 months, and was just recently able to improve my credit to a place where I could qualify for a loan and buy a new car from Hyundai. That is the one and only reason I did not return to Drivetime to buy... I chose new over used of course. When I returned the vehicle Joe was there again, and made that process very easy, too. Quick and painless. All of the team members who've helped me for the past year were fantastic. The phone line for info is always quick, and getting help to get approved for some light maintenance (brakes and oil changes) was very easy w the phone operators and Sears team. They have a program that automates the whole thing. They text me to remind me of an upcoming payment, and the one and only time I needed an extra couple days, they obliged. I have and would again recommend this Drivetime to friends and family who need help getting a good used car on less than perfect credit. The team there deserves a pat on the back and a genuine thank you from me, as genuine as theirs felt a year ago when they got me off the bus and onto the road again. Thank you.",Positive
I didn't even want to give it one star truly the worst customer service. They really don't care about people and all there cars are crap. DONT BUY from here!!,Negative
Truly the worst experience I have ever encountered at a car dealership. Kept giving me same excuse day after day that they were waiting on a reply from the bank. I was trying to get a car with my boyfriend but then they said something was wrong with his social security card which there isn't. Now all the money that I gave as down payment paid in cash they can only return to me in the form of a check. So now I am out my money and a car. Should have just told us this from the beginning I would have never used this place ever.,Negative
"Drive Time sell over priced buckets with bullet holes dents want you to put down 1400.00 for a leased vehicle with over 130,000 miles that's crazy . For a purchase they want 4700.00 to 5000.00 you can go to a big dealership with that with bad credit . Be careful not desperate you won't make it to the state line with these cars .",Negative
"We bought our vehicle from Drive Time on Sahara in March '08 Chrysler Town & Country with all the bells and whistles. We drove it off the lot and on our way home the check engine light came on, took it over to Ted Wiens/Firestone to find that there was a massive oil leak, didn't have it for a week. Following that there has been nothing but problems with it. The radiator is bad but is ""covered"" under warranty so they said it was denied. The caliper in the rear brakes locked up while I was drive and was towed not once but twice. It needs new motor mounts because they are cracked I went over to Drive-time advising them of these issues and was told by a ""manager/salesperson Nathan"" when asked why this wasn't fixed when it went through their ""inspection"" prior to putting this vehicle on the lot. His quote was ""those are human beings back there and make mistakes"" WTF .. pretty big mistake. He said it is cheaper for Ted Wiens to fix the problems then for Drive-time too. There customer service sucks I was on hold for 1.5 hours today. You want good business you go out of your way to make your customers happy especially when you bought a vehicle for $15K. I told this person I will never ever buy another car from them I have nothing good to say (except for Eric he was very helpful from the get go) I told Nathan (mgr) I have been in this town since 1981 hubby born and raised I know a lot of people. After leaving those yoyo's we called our warranty company Averex who told us the radiator was covered. Went back to Ted Wiens/Firestone after being on hold for 45 mins the radiator and only the radiator will be fixed. Rear calipers. motor mounts and thermostat or the rack & pinion will not be fixed. I am still not able to drive this vehicle in the 3 months we have owned this vehicle I have only been able to enjoy it for a month. I have a '97 Toyota Tacoma & '02 Toyota Sienna with nothing wrong with them. We thought we would buy a newer vehicle to enjoy, it has only been a nightmare.",Negative
"This dealership is absolutely terrible and I wouldn't be surprised if these 5 star reviews came directly from the employees themselves seeing as how a salesman ASKED me to give them a good review after my purchase. I was reluctant to even buy a car 2 months ago and I was simply browsing their inventory. I ended up getting pressured into financing a Honda Civic. The night I brought the car home, I went to sleep and woke up for my graveyard shift. When I went to leave for work the car didn't start, so I assumed I had left an interior light on. I didn't have time to jump it so I got a ride to work. The next day, I got a jump, and the car drove fine. During this day I decided it would be best if I kept my old car and returned my Honda. I loved the car but I just wasn't ready for the financial commitment. The next day I get in the car to return it and again the car wouldn't start. I asked a neighbor to give me a jump and once it started, smoke came flying from under the hood making a loud, high pitch noise. I finally got the car back to drive time and got my down payment back. The next day I called to asked if I could go back and get my CDS out of the car and they said it was in the shop. 2 weeks later, still in the shop. 1 month later, still in the shop. Today marks 2 months since my purchase and apparently I will not be able to retrieve my CDS because the car JUST went from the shop to an auction this week. This place is an absolute, money hungry joke. No apology, no explaination.",Negative
"DriveTime makes the used car/poor credit buying experience easy. 1) Go online, look at cars, get approved for inhouse loan (everyone gets approved, the amount varies based upon your provable income) 2) Get a call from the dealer or set an appointment at one of the two lots in Las Vegas. 3) Go to your appointment, pay $1000 down (or more, but 1k is the minimum), leave with vehicle. The good news is that once you are approved, so long as your references and job verification check out, you won't be denied so you don't have to go through hours of paperwork after finding your car to find out you can't get financed. Joe was an excellent sales rep. They do not negotiate the price so there is no hard sell. He was very informative about the processes, even refusing to show me a car because when he looked at it he didn't feel it was ready to be seen. They offer you water and popcorn while you wait. Their cars are all on the lot and they will take you out on a test drive in as many as you want. All the cars we looked at were in good condition, clean, and started up immediately with a good sounding engine. I found the vehicle I wanted. Now comes the reason this place doesn't have 5 stars. The paperwork took a ridiculously long time to prepare. I literally sat chatting with Joe for almost 2 hours while they apparently retyped everything that had been entered when I applied into a different system. They assured me they are getting new systems soon but still you need to know that when you do the purchase, you will need to be there for a while, or go have lunch and come back. The other thing to be aware of, although it is not a complaint, and I do not feel that Joe or the business tried to hide anything from me. In fact, when I inquired, they were very friendly and open about it. However, you need to know the payment quote will include a powertrain warranty and a vehicle locator system totaling about 3k. While these are optional, the payment quote included them and only when I asked was I told they were optional. Don't misunderstand me, they didn't hide it from me nor did they try to make me keep it when I inquired, but they just didn't tell me they were included on the estimate. Moral is, read the estimate first before you commit to the deal and don't be afraid to ask questions. Your payments will be biweekly and they do have a GPS locator and kill switch if you don't make your payments timely. Other than that, the experience was great and I walked away with a car I am very happy with. If you have difficult credit, this is a great place to go.",Positive
"The experience I had at Drivetime was awesome. I talked to Joe on the phone with lots of questions, and he didn't hesistate to answer any of them. He booked me an appointment the following day. When I arrived I was greeted by Glenn who took care of us so that we wouldn't need to wait. We looked at only the cars I wanted to look at and he never pressured me into getting anything else. I ended up getting a beautiful 2012 Dodge Avenger, it was literally an in and out process. They really work with you when it comes to a down payment (you have 60 days to come in and put more towards a down payment to lower your monthly bill). Joe had told me that they do not work off commission, so you really have no pressure to buy anything then and there. They keep your possible loan open for 40 days, so you have time to think. Also, if you refer anyone to buy a car from them you get credit towards your loan. It was overall the best experience at a car dealership I've ever had!",Positive
"These guys are Wow, we found a vehicle which was great an it needed to be looked at they said it would be an they would call us.. they next day we drive by it's back on the lot an No call.

On to the car searching I wasn't really pick at this point because I just needed something to get me to school and work. They let me Look at 3 cars in my price range, and luckily for me I found a beautiful Toyota Yaris.

I was referred to this shop by a fellow NSRA Member. While I didn't have a transmission problem they were eager to help me with the electrical problem on my 40 FORD street rod. They did a great job both diagnosing and repairing my car and very reasonable too . I would recommend Earls Transmission to anyone who needs there car repaired. A great bunch of guys!,Positive
"Earl's Transmission! What a find amongst the many repair shops out there... Let me begin by saying I have a 2001 Pontiac Trans Am with the 4L60E. Anyway, was referred to this shop by a friend even though I received a quote from Bacas National Transmission service already. And that quote was $2300 out the door. Stopped by Earl's and was quoted no more than $2000 with a more realistic range of $1800. My order wasn't just a rebuild either. I wanted an upgrade. A mild upgrade which some might call a ""Stage 2."" Able to handle some 500-600 HP. But still very street legal (in fact, not even racing my car-just for streets). With that being said, everything was done in 2 days with a total of $1886. Not only was the work done fast but it was done at a VERY fair price. Just got the car back today and will be taking her to California very soon. That will be the real test! But I feel very confident and very pleased! Would definitely recommend! Thanks Earl and the technicians! *UPDATE* - Now 5 months later with my upgraded 4L60E and a handful of trips to California and I am very pleased! Shifts real fast and the car is real aggressive. Just what I wanted. Haven't had any problems so far!",Positive
"Earl's Transmission stands by there word, I have a 2001 Lincoln Navigator that had a transmission fail on me. They repaired it and a couple of months later we had another issue with it and they repaired it at no cost. They will have our business from now on out.",Positive
I have a small business and had Earl's recommended to me by a mechanic friend. I've had Earl's work on our company vehicles four times. I've always gotten excellent service at a good price. It's more than worth it to take your transmission problems to Earl's.,Positive
"Let me start by saying that finding a good transmission shop is very difficult. Already spent several thousand dollars with another shop that kept my truck for a total of 5 weeks, including several trips. Once with a tow truck because the expensive high performance parts they charged me for blew up within 500 miles. After all this my truck was leaking transmission fluid all over my driveway. Leaking from the front and back. BIG MESS! ****LESSON**** Should have gone to see Jimmy and his brother at Earl's Transmission Service in the first place, would of save time, and lots of $$$, thousands in my situation. These guys are no thrills, old school, know what they are talking about when it comes to transmissions! They had my transmission pulled the same day, removed all the silicone that the last shop used and replaced the several seals to stop all the leaks. My truck is supercharged with lots of high performance engine/exhaust, and suspension parts. No matter, they had it repaired and ready by the NEXT DAY! *****WOW**** Oh, and they are super reasonable on their rates! Thanks guys.",Positive
Worst DJ I've ever heard. Don't need a trainwreckin' dj while I'm getting an oil change. Ya discount day and I feel like you owe me from having to listen to that.,Negative
Today I needed a oil change before heading to Columbia. I called the 10 minute oil change and of course they were able to take me immediately! Thought I had to wait for about 20 minutes until it was my turn it took about 15minutes for them to change my oil. The gentleman that was assisting me {Christian} was very helpful and informative with the updates that I needed for my car. He even provided me with pricing on how I can take care of the areas. Great over all service and I was highly pleased for my first experience with the 10 minute oil change. The prices are much higher than my normal $25.00 at NTB but you're paying for convenience and speedy service unlike NTB who was completely booked today.,Positive
"Car inspections here take forever. Ask upfront as soon as you pull up how long. You will wait in line at the doors, then they will park it, wait even longer, then they will get to you. Took about 2 hrs on what appeared at first to be a slow day.",Negative
"Excellent quality service, and fast & efficient too! I have brought four different vehicles to this business for oil changes, alignment, and other issues - and I have always been treated in a courteous manner and they have always been honest and fair with the work they have performed on my vehicles. Which is exactly why I am a repeat customer!! I high recommend these guys!!",Positive
"Don't go here if you have a competitor coupon, although sign says they honor competitors' coupon they DON'T!! Manager's excuse they don't have a code for it! Won't come back again!!",Negative
Took my car in today for an oil change and new tires. Great service and reasonably priced. Explained everything well and weren't pushy.,Positive
Went in and paid around $200 for a spark plug tune up. Put in my spark plugs completely wrong and they ended up tugging my accelerator cable out of place. My gas pedal dropped limp and my car accelerated out of control. Had both of my feet pressed on the brake as hard as possible to try and get my car to stop. Thank God I was in my neighborhood and able to pull my keys out of the ignition. Had I been on the interstate or main road I could have m KILLED myself! Not to mention they were stingy with my refund and only chose to pay me back for the exact labor of $154. This is how much I paid for the Ford Dealership to fix the problem! Never go here! It was a complete headache that took me over a month to get solved. Express Oil Corporate is a fraud and completely unprofessional! I almost lost my LIFE!,Negative
"Very friendly staff. Not pushy, but very suggestive. Great to find a shop that is patient and really tries to explain the services they're suggestion and the possible problems you ma be in store for in the moth short and long term. Can't complain. The prices are affordable. Great customer service. Overall pleased with this place.",Positive
"I went in for an oil change and mentioned to the technician that my MAP sensor had triggered my check engine light. I generally don't opt. in to recommended service but the technician specifically recommended I let them change my fuel filter and service the fuel system. I was hesitant as I wasn't sure at the last mileage I had serviced the fuel system and changed the filter. He agreed to look over the filter prior to me making a decision. He stood by his recommendation and I agreed to let them do the work. In conclusion my check engine light is off, it turns out that a clogged fuel line can cause this light to come on. When I realized the light was off I immediately called to thank the technician and he advised hopefully it will stay off but if it comes back on then I know it's an electronic issue. I always recommend express oil change for oil changes because they are quick. Now I'm more likely to go back for other work.",Positive
"Slow service, came in at 10:30 am to get inspection. Didnt leave till 12:10pm. If you got time to waste then go ahead. When i went ro ask what was taking so long, the inspection guy said it was because i was after the acura MDX. Then theres a BMW then a red civic that somehow jumps me....i ask him whats going on he says oh they were also infront. Bullshit aside service is SLOW. Got out at 12:10pm after complain at 11:45 whats the hold up and why has my car has been ""behind other cars"" when theres no car in the garage.",Negative
These guys are great. Super efficient and very friendly. I never feel like I'm being swindled into something I don't need. They'll be honest if something needs to be done or can wait until the next trip.,Positive
"Hands down the best oil change experience I've ever had. I had a coupon for a free oil change up to $39. The gave me the full synthetic ($69) one instead. Because I drive a Jeep it takes a little more than the standard 5 qt. They added the additional oil at no charge. They also topped off my washer fluid and coolant. Everyone was great, especially Austin who was the one that helped me. Will definitely be back.",Positive
"This has been one of the best, non stressful experiences I've had with auto repair. I went for an oil change, even though the price was high, because it was quick. I spoke with them about repairs because they pointed out I needed a belt replaced, without pushing me to get it done then. I went back a week later because they had been so friendly and straight forward because I thought even if the prices were a little too high they seemed very efficient and trustworthy. They called to inform me of the actual cost (tax and all) before doing any work and ended up getting a better price than anywhere else I'd had a quote. I will definitely be going here for any future auto needs.",Positive
"I would reccommend spending my money with a more professional staff. Reception woman was very rude and even laughed when asking about their facility, and I am new to the area and never seen the shop. When asked if they were busy, she said uhhh of course. Guess they are cocky since they get a lot of business.",Negative
"These guys are amazing they went far and above the level of service of an oil change for me today.. I had to wait a little longer than anticipated but didn't mind.. They are used to seeing me in there for my regular service so said ""hi"" and asked how I was . I guess they could tell by my response that my year has started off pretty badly, well the 2 managers changed my burned out reverse light I had and gave me a great discount which due to my monetary situation and dire need for an oil change was a huge deal, it actually made me cry.. I will always recommend them and always go here . These guys rock and truly saw me as a person not doing so great and changed my day . That alone will make me never go elsewhere ... Thank you . Thank you. Thank you !",Positive
"I can't remember the last time I was blown away by an oil change service, but this place has smoked them all. I pass by everyday and finally decided to swing in for a quick oil change when traffic became a bit of a pain. I was greeted outside the bay and directed in. The manager explained their process and asked me some questions about my truck. Then, because I was new to the state, he called over Amanda, who does their inspections and she gave me a run down of state requirements: what needs to be done, time frames, etc. After Amanda went above and beyond, they told me more about my vehicle than the guy who sold it to me. Crazy amount of useful knowledge there. No less than 4 people checked out the truck and everybody was helpful. Nobody tried to push a useless product on me either. What a breath of fresh air. Love this place and I've never been more excited about getting vehicle work done. Kudos.",Positive
"I made my appointment for an 4:30 pm to have a lug screw, nut replacement along with an oil change and battery. I was greeted with a nice employee at first.. then as time went on didn't see the van move for about 45 minutes till 5:10 pm, then it was put on the rack for another 10-15 minutes before the tire came off. By the time they really started the work on the van was 6 pm real close to closing time. Then this went on for 35 to 40 minutes before they completed the job after monkeying around try to put the brakes back on.. they rushed the oil change job while the brakes were finishing it up with the battery. After all of this I did get the oil change free, taxes taken off, and all the enviromental fees as well. Sad thing is the left hand is not talking to the right hand... if you know my meaning.",Negative
"I've been taking my car to these guys for oil changes for the past 2 years. The place is clean, staff is quick and friendly and I've never felt like I've been ripped off. They even double check and catch mistakes other mechanics have made on my Infiniti. I recently had a little more trouble out of my old car and took it to them for more then an oil change. Roger, Amanda and Squibbs (had to give specific shout outs) took care of me and sent me on my way with a well running car and again I didn't feel ripped off. I always struggle to find a place that feels honest when it comes to this stuff. At Express Oil Change I've never had that problem.",Positive
"These guys are always fast, clean, friendly, professional, and most importantly, they're honest! I won't take my car anywhere else for an oil change. I haven't needed any mechanical service since I've been coming here but when I inevitably do, this is where I'm bringing my car. The price of an oil change rivals any other place around, and is actually cheaper than many others. Plus, their name is accurate. The longest an oil change has ever taken was about 15 minutes, and that's because they also changed my air filter. When I used to go to Walmart I could end up waiting for two hours. But above all, their honesty is my favorite part of Express Oil Change. Their techs have told me when I could go without changing a filter or some other service if it could wait until next time. The couple of times I've opted for an ail filter change, the cost is exactly the same as what it would cost me at Autozone. No ridiculous markup! These guys really are the best.",Positive
"Cleanest ""garage"" I have seen in many years. All of the men were working and cleaning. Great team work. Service was quick and efficient.",Positive
"What a wonderful place! I had pulled my car in today to look for the Diamond to my sisters ring that had fallen out of the bag, Mike S & Lance Eubanks( lance is the owner of the car wash next door) came over to me after they realized something was up. Pulled my car in the parking lot and Mike came out and started helping me look. Never once was rude and kept telling me that we were going to find this diamond. After he took the center consul out, he made a decision to bring my car into the shop and take the seats out. After a stressful hour or so, Mike found the diamond. All I can say is that people like this are awesome, it makes your realize that there are wonderful people that are willing to help out when you are in need. Even though the shop was busy he never stop until he found it. I can not pay him back enough for the efforts that he did today, his whole staff kept checking on me to make sure that I was ok until it was found. This place is AWESOME and I will be back for future work and make sure that I recommend this place to all my family and friends. MIKE YOU ARE AWESOME!",Positive
As soon as i pulled into the parking lot i was greeted in a friendly manner by one of the guys. I came here for an oil change at lunch. It was pretty basic. It seemed kind of pricy but I guess that's the price of convenience. It was nice to not have to make an appt. I would only come here for the basics. (Oil change or an inspection),Positive
"This place is called Express Oil Change and has a side business called ""Same Day Mechanical."" I had my pick up in for coolant leak. They said lower intake manifold gasket cause. Book time to repair 3.6hours. Should be done in 1/2 to one full day. I agreed. It took them 5 (five) full working days to repair. YES ""FIVE"" days. Should have know what to expect. Took 1/2 day for diagnosis. Told would be done next day. Day 2-not done. Excuse: only one mechanic on duty. No other A-techs. Day 3-not done: Top of engine in pieces. Mechanic says ""I used to work for GM dealer."" ""I want to 'focus' on getting this done."" ""I'm gonna stay late tonight and finish."" ""Will be done by noon tomorrow."" Day 4-not done: Top of engine STILL in pieces. Mechanic says ""It will be done shortly"". SHIT AC compressor was not even in place. No F****in way it could have been done. Day 5. Go in. 2 other A-techs working on it. Mechanic who said he needed, and wanted to, focus on it was not there. It was his day off. Was not done. They finished up after hours. Truck working fine now. Runs well. Price OK. Big jobs like this never cheap. So, if you want just a quickie oil change. Good luck. If you have a more complicated mechanical issue they can get it done, but NOT in a reasonable, timely manner. Oh yea, on way out a lady brought in her FIAT to get an oil change. 5 A-techs stood around in trying to figure out how to get oil filter removed....... (5 big guys standing around this lil car looking at each other. Hilarious.) . . Be careful my friends .",Negative
"After trying a handful of quick-change garages in the Charlotte area, I think I have found the spot to go to from here forward. From the guy who came out to my car before I'd even pulled in completely, to the technician that had me go with him for the drive to road test the tire balance and rotation, I think these folks do a really solid job. No more steering wheel vibration! Waiting in the customer waiting room (there's a TV and free wi-fi), another customer had some major stuff going on with her car. They did what they could to prioritize the work so that the important stuff she could afford got done. She seemed pleased as well. $59 for a full oil change with balancing and rotating the tires seems pretty reasonable to me. I'll be back. If you are having more serious work done that requires a wait, there is a Dunkin Donuts and a Taco Bell within a stone's throw. Other restaurants nearby too.",Positive
"My oil light was blinking incessantly and I wasn't due for an oil change for another few hundred miles or so, well I stop by this place on my lunch break, and told them the problem & that I only had a short time. They bumped me up and worked on my car right away and fixed the issue by changing my oil and checking for any leaks, all while I was in my car. When I asked them what I owed them they said nothing! What nice people and great service! I will definitely be going back.",Positive
Won't quote on a small repair without getting oil change ...... refused to quote me until I got in line for the oil change ..... not a smart way to build business. I would call it bait and switch at its finest ! ! also OVER Priced when it comes to standard oil changes.,Negative
"These dudes are professional. As I pulled into the parking lot, one came running out ready to help! They took the car and it should be fixed within an hour. Gracias! Clean waiting room, free keurig coffee and some gumball machine. Kinda far from us, but we got a referral. New and right next to a car wash! Great cust. service and we left with a coupon. I am happy.",Positive
"Let me share an experience from today (04/23/18); brought my car in to have a tire patched (slow leak). 3-4 hr wait. Was told that Firestone only covered 12,000 mi or 12 mos on tire warranties from Fletcher's which Firestone obtained apprx 2 yrs ago. Tires are still inside 40k mi warranty, but outside the 12 mo time/12K mi window's. Finally, the service advisor got off his duff and went outside to check the tire. When he came back, I was told ""I can't patch that tire because it has a wear ring that indicates possible internal damage to the blackwall"" Me: ""A what? So I have to drive with a slow leaking tire?"" He: ""I can fill with air"" The SA gave me a quote for 168.33 for replacement tire. Frustrated, I left. On a whim, I wound up at Discount Tire about a mile closer to home. The store Manager Chris walked me out to inspect the tire and found a torn/chafed valve stem. He checked the other 3 and they were in the same condition. I walked out of the store about 1.5 hrs later with 4 new valve stems + tire balance for 20.00 At no time did a Discount Tire service tech inform me of any ""damage ring"". I suppose it's possible if the rim rides on the tire long enough to cause outside blackwall damage. But geezus...... If don't mind wasting your hard earned cash on goods or services you don't need, then by all means, visit this Firestone Complete Auto Rip-off, I mean Care. Otherwise, visit Discount Tire. My NEW tire place. Discount Tire is more interested in making a new customer into an old customer.",Negative
"Don't be fooled! The manager at this location seems very caring and helpful, but in reality their service and workmanship are HORRIBLE. I have learned over time that everything they did for my son's car either needed to be redone or they flat out lied and didn't even perform the service I paid for. Things were installed incorrectly so that other problems would occur. Through negligence they broke the rack and pinion steering that they had to replace in doing so they installed it incorrectly so that it broke the power steering line and then had the nerve to tell me that it was normal wear and tear. None of the bolts were tightened down correctly which has caused steering and alignment issues. The entire time this unscrupulous business and manager were acting like we were a priority to them and that they pride themselves on safety. What a load of BS! I wouldn't trust this autoshop with even the smallest repair or oil change! ABSOLUTE CROOKS!",Negative
"I initially called the day before to set up an appt to get my brakes checked the next day at 1:00pm. I walk into Firestone a few mins before my scheduled appt and I tell the guy behind the desk that I have an appt and what it's for. He just stood there looking at me confused. Then, looks me up in their system and asks if I want to wait for them to finish or leave my car with them. I asked how long it would take and he told me their technician was out to lunch AND they were backed up at the moment. Someone please tell me why I even made an appt or why they accept appts if they are not going to honor it?! Never going there again. EVER.",Negative
"As others have said working with a store manager, Daniel, who is honest, reliable, fair, and not ripping you off is very refreshing. I'm not sure who others worked with, but Daniel offered alignment very reasonably for my four new tires, which were priced lower than Costco, Discount Tire, and Walmart. This restored my faith in customer service. What a nice feeling your not being ripped off, which I have constantly felt at Bell Ford. Thank you Daniel and your excellent technician. I appreciate you. Mark Treegoob",Positive
"I have 2 older models of auto(1999 & 2007) Darren has gone above and beyond time and time again,his knowledge and wisdom dictating which work needs to be done,and which work has to be done. This is not a quicky oil change shop.Make an appointment and your vehicle will be given the proper attention.",Positive
"I usually hate getting oil changes due to all the upselling. However, I had a much different experience at Fletcher's Auto on 12th and E. Bell Rd. The ""Brake Fluid Low"" notification came on my dashboard so when I took it in to have my oil changed I mentioned the warning light. The manual says low brake fluid is usually because the brake lining is wearing down so I asked Fletcher's to repair the brakes the same day. I was expecting to have a repair bill, but to my surprise they checked my brakes and they were fine! I appreciated their honesty and they have won my business for sure.",Positive
"This is my first visit to a Fletchers tire and i won't go back. I had a groupon for an alignment and wanted to try them. As soon as the employee saw i had the groupon his demeanor changed. he was clearly annoyed and not very helpful. When the car was done he simply said here are your keys, thanks for coming in. no paperwork, no mention of what was done. i have had alignments done elsewhere before and they ALWAYS told me or provided a print out of how far out it was and the adjustments made. And they mention warranty. when i asked for details the fletchers guy says, the tech did the work and he doesn't discuss it with me. no print out, no explanation. he then says we do this for free. groupon keeps the money and we do these for free. Really? What business would do that? and if you don't like it, why keep doing it? this groupon has run quite a while. the customer service is non exisent there. he grudgingly printed me an invoice but i had to ask twice. Stay away from this place",Negative
"Unfortunately Yelp makes you leave at least 1 star. I've had major work done on my old vehicle at the Fletcher's on Cave Creek probably 3-5+ times and loved them. Not sure why there's such a difference in service between this location and that one (not to mention the stars), but in the 3 different interactions I had with the same person at the Bell location.. I'm honestly disgusted. Darren needs a MAJOR attitude adjustment and for that alone I would never recommend that location or take my business to any of their other locations. Really though.. 2 stars about sums that place up.",Negative
Need to fix this review. Gentlemen seemed nice so I gave a good review...too soon I suppose. They called me back after having my car for an hour and told me it'll be three times the original estimate. What a waste of a day.,Negative
"I bought a groupon for 2 oil changes, my 2nd experience was at the location of 1141 E Bell Road Phoenix, AZ 85022. This was a one time using this location, they changed the oil within 30 minutes, and didnt charge me for any extra fees, and provided great service. I would definitely go back to the Fletchers on Bell Rd again and refer others to this location. Unfortunately, at a different location, 2825 W Carefree Hwy, Phoenix, AZ 85085, my 1st experience was a lot different. This location tried to tell me I needed engine work, tried to scare me into high dollar repairs, they didnt feel like even doing the oil change, was their tactic because of radiator fluid that came out, due to too much excess in the reserve, not needing engine repairs. This visit was a over 2 weeks ago and thank God it was just this locations way of doing business, try to scare the client into spending money! And yes they charged me then for extra fees, tax etc after the groupon was used also.",Positive
"I had the worst auto repair experience I have ever had in my life (I'm 54) here. I had always heard that Fletcher's took care their customers. Since I needed a costly repair, they are very close, and they had financing options, I decided to give them a try. FIRST THING...WARNING ABOUT THEY'RE EASYPAY FINANCING! There were no details about interest rates or monthly payments when applying and being accepted. I called both Fletcher's toll-free number and this location and was told they had no idea what the terms were but I would find out after the repairs were completed and the charges were put through. Really? Unfortunately, I needed my car fixed. I didn't have any idea it was even legal to charge 96% interest (I have decent credit). I was assured that my car would be ready the next day or, at the latest, early the next week. I brought my car in mid-day on a Friday. They definitely over-promised. My car was ready the following Thursday. Of course, the repairs got delayed because they left my car outside Sunday night and my driver's window was broken, and my battery was stolen. They did pay for the replacement window and battery, but they didn't even vacuum the broken glass up. Additionally, whomever put the new window in, did not remove all the glass from the frame so it won't even roll up completely. Since I picked up my car, I have a vibration in my front end that was not there previously. I am afraid to go back though. I'm worried they may do more damage.",Negative
"I bought a Groupon for this location for an oil change and tire rotation. Got the oil change, of course they came back saying everything was wrong with my car. But what really pissed me off was that they said my cabin air filter was dirty and I had just changed it at an Auto Zone before my appointment. So I knew they were completely bullshitting me, and just trying to sell me everything. And on top of that, they said they couldn't rotate my tired because I needed new ones anyway. So I didn't even get what I paid for out of the Groupon!! Needless to say, I made an appointment at Discount Tire while they were finishing up with my car and am NEVER GOING BACK TO THAT LOCATION. Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I don't know about cars.",Negative
I originally took my vehicle to fletchers on 35th ave and union hills. They would not release my vehicle they had done so many extra things to my vehicle without my consent that I could not pay for. So I actually had a mechanic look at my vehicle and they said that all i needed was alignment. This was a friend of mine. So I took it to fletchers for the alignment. They told me it would take a few hours so no problem. Then they called me and said all this stuff was wrong with my vehicle and that they are not going to do the alignment that I already paid for unless i do all this other stuff. KEep in mind my mechanic friend said that the only thing I needed was the alignment. I called to talk to a manager. He cussed at me and hung up on me. I also found a few reviews that state they have done the exact same thing to them. THis is absolutely horrible. DO not go to these locations. Especially Bell road.,Negative
So Sam tells me that they left wires switched. Too bad they didn't also tell me they switched coils. One week later and finding a diagram showing the correct way I get it running myself. Too bad they prefer to have an unhappy customer. Oh and I was told that I didn't hear home correctly. Wow. The customer is wrong here apparently. Zero stars. #failureincustomerservice,Negative
I've been coming here for over 2 years and never been disappointed. Just had major brake work done and Darren was there to help me out every step of the way. Darren was great to work with and was very professional. I recommend Fletchers!,Positive
"Well, against my better judgement I did make an appointment because I got a coupon. ""Darren"" must be writing his own reviews because the service was as bad as the Yelp reviews said. Keep me waiting 25 minutes and NO customer skills what so ever! Can i give no stars?!",Negative
"Darren helped me out big time today. I used the groupon for an already ridiculously reduced price for an oil change and accessory service and he continued to drop a couple prices on some of the accessory services to help me out. He even showed me some other issues with my truck and explained to me (without making me feel stupid) what the problems were, how to fix them, and the cost. I would recommend this location and company to anyone!",Positive
I have had nothing but great experiences at this Fletchers. I have taken my car here several times and have always received great customer service.,Positive
"Can I give a 0 star? The customer service is horrible, slow and they were not being respectful at all, waste of time. I'd rather pay more and go somewhere else. Worst service ever.",Negative
"My boyfriend and I took in our 06' Dodge Durango to see if we could get the brakes fixed that day. They were grinding and were not feeling safe at all. When we walked in the guy at the front desk was very impatient with us and talked down to us as though we were children. That by it self was enough to make me want to bolt, I don't take well to being spoken to that way. But the worst part was, even after checking he had the parts in stock, he told us he couldn't do it because he was closing in half an hour. Now mind you the sign says they close at 530PM, and it was only 430PM. Doing the front brakes with all the parts available only takes about 45 min. He told me and my boyfriend it would take at least 3 hours and that we HAD to call a head and schedule but he didn't have anything up for about a week or two. So we said no thank you and went to leave. But the good news after calling around and some driving we were able to go to Brakes Plus on Tatum and Bell, they were amazing! I called to set up an appointment for the next day with them, but they told us to come on in anyway and they could do it right then and there, even though they closed in less than an hour. They stayed an extra 10 min in the end, just for us. It was a huge relief considering once the tires were removed the showed us just how bad it had been. We were driving with no brakes. No one at Fletcher even looked at our truck. I can't imagine what would have happened if we had waited to schedule a week or two out like he wanted. Bad form Fletcher, bad form.",Negative
"I have only had positive experiences here. I'm grateful for the Groupons.. I could afford to get both front & rear brakes done and they'll always fit me in anytime to check my tire pressure, or fluid levels. And they've always been very nice. Just one thing- I think they need a really good, solid front desk coordinator who is at the front desk all of the time.",Positive
"Left the oil cap off after a recent oil change. Never, never again will I go here. Those groupons might save ya a dime or two but will cost you loads in the long run. Horrible.",Negative
"I am very happy in particular with Steve @ Fletchers In Cave Creek on Carefree Hwy. I bought some new tires and they are like driving on silk and oh so quiet. When it came time to leave, my battery was dead and everyone else was busy, so Steve got his tools out and installed it for me. I am a very happy customer, Thanks to Steve.",Positive
"If I could give ZERO stars I would. I just moved to this area from Ahwatukee and this is my second time coming to this location and THEY ARE THE WORSE. The last time I came for an oil change they told me it was a three hour wait. Today he told me I had 10 people in front of me. I spoke to this Derrick guy and he's rude and unprofessional and lazy. He gave me every reason in the world for why I should come back, why I should leave my car or why it's not good to come on Saturday. I kept saying to him ""I need an oil change"" like regardless of what ur saying I still need an oil change. When I was in Ahwatukee I purchased this ""Family Plan"" that gives you so many free oil changes and discounts etc. That was great when I lived in Ahwatukee because the Fletcher's out there was AWESOME. However here. I hate it. If I it wasn't for the ""Family Plan"" I wouldn't ever come here for service. Ever. As soon as this runs out I will never return. Horrible horrible place and horrible staff.",Negative
We bought tires less than 2 1/2 years ago from this Fletcher. They were Firestone tires which have splitting issues. They are now splitting and are not standing by their warranty. Interesting that Fletcher no longer sells Firestone tires? That's because they sold us a bad product. DO NOT buy tires here. They do not stand by their product. Go to Big O or Discount Tire. I know they warrant their tires.,Negative
"Horrible and awful are not strong enough words. I have taken my work trucks here a few times due to some groupon coupons, but never again. I took my s-10 in a couple weeks ago. They fixed the seals and said that would fix it. 2 months later I'm still going through a quarter of oil per week. Took the day off work yesterday just to get my truck fixed. Dropped it off at 8:30am. Arrogant guy behind the counter asked ""what if I can't get it back to you until Monday."" I told him that I'd have to go somewhere else because work starts at 6:30am Monday. He said no problem, he'd give me a call shortly. I called at 3:45 and he said he was going to look at it in the morning. I reminded him of our conversation and he said oh yeah. I then asked if they could do it now and they said no, they close in 15mins, which means I wasn't even going to get a phone call before they closed. When I went in same arrogant guy behind the counter never apologized and said ""when"" I bring it back in he'll waive the $90 diagnostic fee. Give me a break, too arrogant to even apologize. DO NOT GO HERE!!!",Negative
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I had a good experience at this Fletchers. We brought our SUV in for a full inspection since we had just purchased it and it was used. We knew it had some issues due to it's age and wanted to ensure it was fit for driving. The person we got it from said he did all the oil changes himself regularly and maintained it the best he could. After the Fletchers inspection they did find that most of the regular maintenance items were in great shape as the previous owner had told us... so points for Fletchers for not trying to sell us something we didn't need. We also noticed that the AC wasn't really as cold as we thought it should be... Fletchers suggested a minor repair and added dye to the AC for us to watch. He said if it starts to not blow cold again then bring it back and they would be able to find any leaks that appear. At the end of the day we did have a lengthly list of items that need to be repaired or that will need service soon... he suggested some items we could do ourselves over a weekend as well. So yes, we had to invest into our car for some repairs but overall I feel they were honest about what we really needed, what we could wait on and what we could do ourselves. They also completed all the work in 2 days. He also found some specials for us and saved us about $100.",Positive
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. It's not just bad service (and read the reviews, the service is beyond bad, it's insulting) these people are CROOKS. I used to live near one of these places and took my car in for an oil change and to have a squeaky belt replaced. I was told my car needed over $600 of service (too long a list to type here) and that ""All my belts"" needed changing. I said, ""Oh, really"" All of them?"" And the mechanic replied ""Yes, you should do all of them at once, and it's $375."" People, my car has ONE belt. I took it to my regular mechanic and he installed it for free (it took about 10 minutes, and he charged me $20 for the belt!) along with replacing the old oil filter Fletcher's left on the car. RIP OFF WITH A BAD ATTITUDE!",Negative
"One of the worst experiences I've had in a long time with a business. I purchased tires from them with their warranty about 6 months ago. Three months ago one of the tires had a leak. They repaired the tire and sent me on my way after leaving the car there from 10am, they finish repairing the tire at 4 pm. A few weeks later the leak is back. They repair it again, this time I drop it off at 8am and they still finish at 3pm.. Another two weeks and the leak comes back again. Finally they are willing to order a new tire. It takes them two months to get the tire, with me calling them every week to check if it's in. It's funny how when I first wanted to buy the tires they were able to get it the next day, but when they need to stand by their replacement warranty, it takes 2 months. Finally they get it and I drop the car off at 11am on a Wednesday. They do not finish with my car until 3:30pm. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take four and a half hours to change a tire. Will never do business with them again and will warn everyone I know about them.",Negative
"I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier. The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work. I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done, as well any other routine maintence im too lazy to do myself, and back to the tires they beat the price on tires for the same tire everywhere else and had them in stock for me the same day!",Positive
"This is my second bad interaction with this dealer. Pros: Friendly Staff Cons: Everything else I went to sell my SUV in on 1/1/2018 and I was given an offer online. During the process I gave my VIN number and the general condition of the which was less than 2 years old and had one accident. I was quote an offer, but when I went to the store the used car manager stated that since the vehicle had been online they would have to significantly reduce the offer price. I was shocked by this revelation because they knew all of the available information before hand when they pull the Carfax to determine offer price. This was a big waste of my time which I value. This dealer's mantra is to do any and everything to get you in the door. It does not make sense to me that I get low-balled for a trade-in, but I have to pay top dollars for used rental cars. Save your time and money and just go to Hertz car sales if buying used. Best case scenario they are simply incompetent by not factoring the vehicle history into the equation. Worst case scenario they attempted sell below the offer price to and sell to KBB at the offer price. Unfortunately for them I am aware of used car salesmen tactics. Also, I know what is a good price for my vehicle because my brother sales cars and has access to auction pricing and dealer market analysis tools.",Negative
"Took my car in on Friday to check why the engine light was on, again, after I had already taken it in a month ago for the same thing. Was told they wouldn't be able to get to it and figure out what the issue was until Tuesday. and no loaner cars of course. So luckily I have a husband and parents with an extra car for me to borrow. I have no idea what other people are expected to do. I will never come back to the service center here. Idk why every charlotte Hyundai dealership is so awful. If you have a Hyundai make the drive up to concord, that service center is amazing, with friendly people who don't make you feel weird and uncomfortable if you're a woman and they actually explain things well. Avoid this dealership like the plague. GO TO MODERN HYUNDAI OF CONCORD INSTEAD. It's a world of difference there and I will be more than happy to drive up there from now on to avoid this terrible place.",Negative
"STAY AWAY!!! These people are absolute liars. We got all the way down to negotiating a price on a car and they send another ""manager"" in that we never spoke to and he tells us they cant do the deal. NO EXPLANTATION at all. Just his other manager says they cant do the deal. We waited around all fucking day and had credit score sent to multiple banks and were told it was a matter of if we would take the 0% interest or the rebates. Then boom...sorry we cant do the deal. What the fuck! When I asked about all the times they shopped the credit score around they made it seem like no big deal. Screw these people, we will never buy a car from them and you shouldn't either!",Negative
"Straight forward sales people and no nonsense or game playing. Cindy found the exact vehicle that I was looking for provided all necessary information and I bought the vehicle with great service from the first contact through the Business office which had me in and out in record time.

"Great service, affordable price, personal touch, always treated like a valued customer. After ~6yrs of going to them, NO complaints.",Positive
"Met with Craig for a vehicle I saw online on a Friday afternoon. Craig was wonderful, but his manager (Ted) insisted on speaking with me before I left the lot. Told them I would not be purchasing the first vehicle I had seen and would be out of town for the weekend. Received a nice email from Craig thanking me for coming in, but Ted left me 5 voicemails between Saturday and Monday. The following Tuesday I negotiated a deal with Craig (and Ted because he insisted on speaking with me again). They faxed buyers order to my bank, and on my way to pick up the vehicle they called to inform me they sold it. (Literally between a time frame of 2:00-5:00.) I hope they got the extra $300 they negotiated because they will not receive my business, nor my family or friend's business because of this terrible customer service experience.",Negative
"Tried to purchase a vehicle. Took a test drive and found a car we were interested in. Due to time restraints we could not get into the numbers that day. We expressed interest, provided contact info, then emailed again expressing interest. No response what so ever. Guess they are too busy. Since I do not beg to make a car purchase, we went to a Charlotte dealer 30 miles out of the way and will be making the purchase there.",Negative
Took my Santa Fe for its first scheduled maintenance and my wife and I were impressed by the staff and the service facility. They even went out of their way for an excellent customer experience.,Positive
"Worst car buying experience! I had leased (big mistake) a car here several years ago. The lease was maturing, so I went to see my options. I went in and immediately said I wanted my car appraised, since that would be the determining factor, so I handed the sales person my keys. He was gone for 10-15 minutes, maybe even longer. We started looking around the showroom and the lot to pass the time. Finally, the sales person finds us, and we test drive a car. We get back to the dealer, and I ask about the appraisal. Over 40 minutes have gone by at this point, and my car has yet to be appraised! Ugh. Another 10-15 minutes go by, and finally, they come back with a number, which was 1500 less than another dealer. (I'm so glad I had it appraised somewhere else first!!) We still inquire about the car we test drove. The sales person was gone for another few minutes, and comes back with an outrageous number, that honestly didn't make any sense. There was a $4,000 discrepancy that was unaccounted for, which the sales person claimed was taxes and fees. I was fed up at that point, so I asked for my keys. It took me asking 4 times before they were returned! Zero customer service skills, and questionable math skills. I'm glad we left and went to another dealership, the difference was night and day! Please take your business elsewhere, you will be glad you did!!!",Negative
"Once again I am disappointed with a car dealership. This should not be a surprise honestly most are more concerned with you signing the dotted line not maintaining customer service after you leave. The experience with my sales person was phenomenal. My issues rests with an issue I've been trying to get resolved for about 2 weeks now. I purchased the dent and ding protection. By the way don't even bother the coverage is a joke not to mention the rim protection one claim per year at a coverage of $125. I called Matt Krest to get contact information for the warranty companies because I wanted to get specific details of coverage. Long story short I found out that the dent and ding protection I purchased on one of the vehicles (yes I purchased two simultaneously) had no record sent over to the warranty company. I proceeded to call back to get this resolved as I found it odd when I had a copy of the contract for the warranty in my hand. On last Friday he called in to the company with me on the phone and they stated they had no record of the policy. I was advised by Matt that he would be talking to the ""girls upstairs"" regarding this as they sent warranty coverages out in batches for the month. Mind you I purchased the vehicles the end of June and we are now in November. I have left two more messages so far regarding what the resolution is and have yet to get a return call. This coverage was an additional $445 on top of my loan. It looks like I am going to have to go out of my way to go back into the dealership to get this resolved. I was initially impressed with Fort Mill Hyundai but as usual after you leave you are just trash or an annoyance when something that the screwed up on the back end needs to be fixed. I've worked in sales and customer service most of my life. You don't drop the buck after the customer leaves that is the time to build upon the relationship and gain return business as well as referrals.",Negative
"Salesperson Paul Shannon, very considerate and good man. He went out of his way to help me. However the used car manager Sean Trueman is extremely rude and demeaning. The sales people there seem to know it too. I was all but wrapped up with a sale and he refused to come to a compromise over a few hundred $ unless I would use their predatory lenders. I had financing in hand and literally, a check from my personal credit union in hand as well as a down payment and a trade in. Then, he had the nerve to say he would give me a .07 discount - yes that's right, 7 cents. That is insulting. I will tell EVERYONE I know to steer clear of this business and I will be reporting my experience to the BBB. UPDATE: just received a call from Ted, they are obviously trying very hard to unload this car but still will not compromise. Hello? The same car with the same trim level (just a different paint job, that's the only difference) is available for $500 less 15 mins away. But I am interested in Fort Mill's car and they will not budge. Clearly, they are not serious about selling this vehicle.",Negative
Everything was fine Car serviced within time frame I was told Waiting area very comfortable Fresh coffee and snacks Would recommend this car dealership to anyone,Positive
We worked with Ray Gough on Fathers Day to purchase a Santa Fe Sport. They were willing to do a deal and made it as painless as possible. Most impressive is that Ray followed up with phone calls to be sure I was satisfied and that I was able to take advantage of the technology of the car. Good service!!,Positive
Great service on my car. Explanations given and no pressure to do any work needed. Service was done in a timely manner. Always love the free car wash! Also a great waiting area with free refreshments and clean restrooms.,Positive
"Worst car buying experience I've ever had, dealer and finance manager both lied about service for the new car that we purchased and promised things that was never delivered. This was my second car I purchased from them, the first experience was good (4 years ago) but the one I recently did (May 2016) was absolutely terrible! I will never go here again and tell everyone I know not to visit this location! I can't stand a company that lies to its customers and promises of items that they never deliver on. Also future customers please be warned their ""You get free car washes for life when you buy cars from us"" is a complete lie. Also be warned that finance managers will try to sneak the Hyundai Extra Warantee on your vehicle stating that ""it's the only way you can get a lower interest rate"". DO NOT GO HERE FOR A NEW CAR!!!!",Negative
"We had to search for another used 15 sonata to replace one totaled in a recent accident. After searching many online listings and visiting more than a few dealers in a week's time we finally ended up striking our deal on a certified 15 sonata at Fort Mill hyundai and couldn't be happier with it. Our sales rep, Zoey L was very kind and patient with our questions. I recommend her to anyone in need of a good person to help you buy that just right car. We also enjoyed working with their finance guy, Elite; he was quick, thorough and friendly. Maybe the lateness of the hours had everyone smiling, but so far everyone involved in our purchase was very helpful, friendly, and professional. Thank you Zoey and team at Fort Mill Hyundai!",Positive
"I loved my old Hyundai and it served me well for 10 years with only one moderately expensive fix needed. Alas when it decided to die it did so in spectacular fashion and the first place I looked was at getting a similar car. My sales associate, Mike S. was great. I loved that he didn't try to sell me on anything other than subtly admiring upgrade features and showing me cars that were out of my price range. My experience with him was 5 stars. The stress came with the negotiating with everyone else for the car purchase. Stressful and no fun but in the end I felt like I got a good deal. The next day someone called me to come in to tell me that the deal I had signed and they agreed to Hyundai would not honor. One of the discounts they gave me had expired and they wanted me to redo everything on my loan. I almost left my shiny new car in disgust, but we were able to work out a deal putting the difference on my trade in so my payments didn't increase. Flash forward to several software recalls mandating service appointments and I have found it is almost impossible to book an appointment with a loaner car at the service center. It isn't that you need to schedule well in advance, which I would be fine with. Two of my three scheduled (with loaner car) appointments I drove down and there was no car for me. It has been so frustrating to spend my lunch break driving to Fort Mill only to find their only suggestion for lacking transport back to my office is to wait. I wish I was allowed to take 2 hour lunches! They aren't the worst car dealer I have heard of but when my car dies I hope I will be able to find somewhere that everything runs smoothly. If you come here I would ask for Mike, plan to stay late and skip the maintenance package.",Negative
"I was uncertain if Jonathan was clear on his job description, but he did not seem keen on working or selling. We were exploring some cars for our son and found him borderline disinterested. After leaving the most poorly laid out parking lot we then took our business to Hendrick Honda and were quite pleased with both the service and selection. Jonathan may not realize he actually works on commission. Certainly would not return or recommend.",Negative
"The people were nice but a bit slow. No one seemed overly anxious to help us. I was paying cash for a used Hyundai so I probably got out a lot faster than anyone trying to finance would have. I had looked at the website before going down to the dealership. The website clearly said the car was a certified used car, which means the Hyundai 100,000 mile warranty is in effect. But when I picked a car the dealer said it costed an extra $2000 to get the car certified. That really seems like false advertising. When I pointed that out to the salesman he said, oh all dealers do that. I thought that was a ridiculous thing to say and really sleazy. I bought the car because I got a good deal, but I am still annoyed I didn't get the certified warranty. I wasn't willing to pay the extra $2000 for it. I'm not sure I would recommend this dealership because of that. I'm still thinking of asking a lawyer about that certified warranty.",Negative
"I have visited and met with over a dozen dealerships and dealers, but nowhere have I received the unfriendly treatment that I received here at Fort Mill.

"I bought my third Elantra in five years from Fort Mill Hyundai in September. They brought the vehicle down from their recently purchased Lake Norman Hyundai dealership. In November it was made obvious to me that the vehicle had been damaged either on the lot or on a test drive and was poorly repaired before being sold to me as new. I had noticed several of the signs of damage within a day of getting the vehicle but didn't put together what it added up to. I had noticed imperfections in the paint on the right rear of the car as well as three clips underneath the back bumper I later found out was to hold a piece of the bumper that was never on the vehicle amongst other things. When I went to Fort Mill Hyundai with this information I spoke with General Sales Manager Dan McColl who was quick to dismiss the issue insisting it happened after the fact and went as far as to state that his supervisor would ""laugh at"" him if he tried to get repairs approved. This was the first time I've ever been treated rudely at a dealership and as a repeat customer was shocked. That evening I emailed his supervisor Chris O'Leary (General Manager) who never bothered to even return my correspondence even after I followed up with several phone calls and left him a message after waiting a week.",Negative

"WORST PLACE EVER to think about buying a car. The sales team is only out for one thing, the sale. They do not stand by their word once the paper work is complete. They make discriminating comments. I sent a letter to the Owner of the company twice and I have yet to receive a comment back. What that says to me is once you're out the door, you don't matter. I would NEVER SEND A FAMILY, FRIEND OR COMPLETE STRANGER TO THIS DEALSHIP. WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had in purchasing a car. Fort Mill Hyundai Gold Hill Rd, Fort Mill SC will NEVER GET MY SERVICE AGAIN!",Negative
ask for Dwayne Johnson and Charles Harper when you go. they were a great pleasure to work with and very patient with me as I spoke to other dealerships. ultimately I ended up doing business with them and couldn't be happier with my new vehicle. also their service department appears to be pretty customer oriented complete with a lounge that has TVs and Internet ready computers along with snacks and drinks,Positive
"Receptionist(s) were always friendly and eager to help, however the sales staff could use a lesson in charm. Usually a better experience but the staff this time around (a few visits) left a bit to be desired (compared to other dealerships in area). I understand buying a car (used in our case) requires a bit of back-and-forth but it didn't seem like our business was truly valued. Our particularly salesmen did actually point out the car we eventually chose (and had not considered before) so it showed he really was listening to what we wanted - so that's a plus. All cars bought are supposed to come with full tank of gas but our sales guy initially only put $20 in (brought it to 3/4 tank). It's not the money to fill up the tank the rest of the way that bothered me but the fact that it's supposed to be full and he didn't bother. My wife took it back in the next day and they were willing to fill it up (good). Great prices on used cars (do research online, you can get the ""internet price"").",Negative
"Typical car salesman....pushy and arrogant!! I went in to look at and test-drive the new Elantra. After walking around the lot looking for one, the salesman said, ""I guess we don't have any."" He claims they are a hot item and they're sold right away. After going inside where he could get my information, I mentioned that I was looking for a standard transmission and he just about popped his lid. He said he didn't know if there were any manual Elantras. After finding out there were, he said he didn't know if they could get one. I said something about ordering on-line, and again he blew his top and said, ""What am I here for?"" I commented, ""I don't know, I just came in to look at and drive a new Elantra."" My question is: If this were such a hot seller, wouldn't a dealer have a demo to drive for people like me who are specifically looking at this car? All I heard from this specific salesman was that he didn't need my business because ""I sold 26 cars last year."" Well good for him, he's not going to sell one to me! This is the second time I dealt with this dealership. I was in there last summer looking at a used manual Elantra. I test drove it and like it. When they offered a discount of $2000, I noticed the sticker price they showed on that written offer was $2000 more than what was plastered on the window of the car. By the way, I went across the street to the (not even opened yet) Fiat dealer. They had the Fiat 500 demo right there to test drive, which I did. I am in need of a vehicle and I think I found my new car. All it took was an available demo to drive and no pushy salesman. That's how cars are sold professionally!!",Negative

Couldn't have been more impressed by the level of knowledge and professionalism by this man and his company! He came to my house; provided the part I needed and diagnosed the real problem I originally thought was the issue. He also went to get the parts I needed and completed my car problems at a very discounted price. If you need an honest and professional mechanic look no further call this man asap,Positive
"I'm very impressed with Dan and Garage 2U....my car has what seemed to be a battery issue and wouldn't start the other day..i,had heard of Garage 2U from an online group and thought I would check them out. I called Dan and explained my problem and he came the next day, with a battery, and got my car running. It turned out that my issue ran a little deeper and I would need a new alternator as well. Dan sent me a very fair estimate including pricing and labor. He was lower prices than all the garages near us...unfortunately due to time constraints and that I would have needed to rent a car we had to go with a local garage that could do same day repair to save the cost of a rental. Had I had the luxury of waiting a few days I would have waited for Dan. He was fair, honest and a truly nice guy. I'm glad I bought the battery from him and he will definitely get further business from us as well as referrals. I would reccomend him 100%.",Positive
"I'm absolutely amazed by the service I received with garage2u. My clutch went out on my Kia and it was pretty much stuck where I parked, which given my schedule, is a massive emergency. Dan came by to look at it within a day of my contacting him---he also worked with me to find the cheapest option for the fix. He also drove my car to his driveway (I only have street parking and you can't do massive repairs in the street) without using the clutch, which in itself is impressive. It saved me the cost of a tow, which was huge. He ordered the parts and got my car done far before I expected it---but not only did he do the original fix, he did a whole bunch of small things on my car that I hadn't even mentioned to him! Fixed a broken door handle, my driver side visor, fixed a plate that was rubbing on my passenger side brakes, took the rust off my rotors, oiled all my door hinges, fixed a wiper blade, the list goes on and on. Never in my life have I experienced that kind of service! I wish I could've paid him more for all that, but money is too tight right now. I've been recommending him to other people (though keep in mind it's starting to get cold out and he works mostly in driveways so check with him on availability). My clutch works beautifully now and I definitely have a new mechanic. Thanks for going above and beyond, Dan.",Positive
"Dan is great - friendly, trustworthy and thorough - all signs of a great mechanic! Dan quickly set up an appointment to come to my home on an Sunday morning, changed out my front end brakes and rotors(while teaching me a thing or two) at almost half the price of the ""other"" guys. No doubt, I will be using Dan and Garage2U in the future.",Positive
I have a 2003 Hyundai Elantra - granted it's a beater. Took it in to the garage to get it inspected and they wanted more than $2K for it to pass. No way. I was ready to sell it. Then I found out about Garage2u. Garage2u is a mobile mechanic. They come to your house (or wherever your car is) and fix it right there. They have all the tools that they need. In my case he worked on my car in the driveway. It couldn't have been easier. And it couldn't have been more cost effective. Way less than half of what the garage wanted. And it passed inspection! Oh and get this. Dan (the mechanic) called me two days later to follow up and make sure that everything was ok with the car. Show me another mechanic that does that! So I get to keep the car a few more years. Many thanks to Dan and Garage2u.,Positive
I recently had a weather related single car accident and was feeling pretty down about it. They fixed my car and I had a great experience picking it up. The lady that works in the office is a pleasure to deal with. The car was fixed well. The gentlemen I spoke with on the phone were lovely. The kind of service that makes you take time out to write a great review. Thanks.,Positive
"Ideal Body Shop has always given me options to consider for the specific type of repair I want. As a woman, I appreciate the respect they show me.

Accidentally clipped a wall while parking...oops! I got several estimates and Gary came out the best. He was a pleasure working with and the car looks great. The only semi negative comment is that it took a little while to get the car in because he is so busy. It was worth worn the short wait though. He shares the garage with a great Guy named Phil who does auto detailing. So I set it up to have the car detailed while it was at the shop. Nothing better than getting your car back with a fresh detail. I would highly recommend both Gary and Phil. One thing I just noticed is that the address on Yelp is their old one farther up Park Street. They are now at 1726 S Park Street.,Positive
"Gary and the guys at Ideal Body did a fantastic job repainting my car after it was badly keyed at a Badger game. They had just moved to their new location in the old Thorstad dealership, but were ready to provide quick, quality work. They handled the insurance company with aplomb. Highly recommended.",Positive
Worst car wash ever. Air conditioning has been broken for 3 weeks. Waiting over an hour and my car hasn't even been driven through. Something is very wrong here. Beware.,Negative
"I've been going here for over 15 years. It used to be the best in town, however it had changed quite a bit and not for the better. I've had it where a guy sprayed the front of my car and the wash went down. He then backed my car out, drive it to the back and started wiping it down like it was washed! This last trip, the a/c is down in the waiting area with these mobile a/c's blowing hot air. Come to find out it's been down for months. The wash was bad too. Wheels weren't even wiped down. Needless to say, this will be the last trip I'll be going to support this business. Sad, used to be the hotspot till new ownership.",Negative
Great service by Brett! He always takes good care of my vehicles. The staff is always friendly and does a good job. Highly recommend this place and Brett!,Positive
"Went here for a nice car wash, I picked out the $34.99 and the guy also sold me on getting my leather seats treated so total $60. I asked him time wise how long would it take so I could decide if I wanted to leave the wash and run some errands while the car was being done he said 1-1 hour 15 mins ok no problem and decided to wait. Well it turned into 2 hours and 15 mins I wasn't the only customer wondering why it was so long. Went up and asked how much longer mind you it's hot outside and the indoors isn't much cooler, they stayed no more than 10 mins ok fine.... we'll that turned into another 30 mins. Finally enough was enough and I just wanted my car back. Was guided in the direction of Brett the ""manager"" who to our surprise was aggressive and out of control. He said what's your problem I would've told you 3 hours. He then began to get shake and when asked why was he getting mad he stated because we are A Holes and we're making him mad. He began to swear like a sailor and then went as far to say ""I'm mad now see what's going to happen"" so he is threatening at this point. The owner can try and defend and say this never happened but even a customer stand behind us said wow that was out of line and out of control the way he acted. We finally just walked away once he threatened and started reaching in his pockets. Enough was enough for me my kid was there with me and it was inappropriate to say the least. I walked over to Brett with my phone in hand recording in case he dare threatened me again and yes I was worried he'd hit me. I asked for my car back and told him what he did and his threat was out of line. He started yelling telling me it was illegal to film- sorry Brett in a legal professional for the state I think I know the law but thanks for you uneducated information. I walked over to my car and asked the gentlemen to stop because I was leaving now 2 hours 45 mins after having my car here for a wash and a wipe down of my leather seats. We asked that the owner contact us but he never did. In reality I should've called the police the moment he threatened us the way he did. I also own a business and would never treat my customers like that because they are upset and questioning the time it's taking. I will never return here. Not to mention I had to go home and finish cleaning it since they didn't vacuum the back and didn't clean the console properly nor the mirrors but yet I paid $60... lesson learned. Customer beware dare you complain then Brett will threaten you and you will as he says ""make him mad"" and the owner has no regard to threats being made to their customers. Shame on you! Here is Brett going crazy! Oh yes and when I asked who the owner was he said Mathew Graham, when I asked how to do I speak with him the reply was ""good luck getting a hold of him and threw his own business card with Brett Welch ""Detail Manager"" again as a business owner myself if I found out my employee treated a customer this way they'd be in the unemployment line. Where are you Matthew Graham? Where is your customer service I'm calling back a customer as requested?",Negative
"Too bad I can't give negative stars, 55 minutes to get a basic car wash, with 3 cars in front of me. Brett the manager is arguing with me about the 2 stars his location has bc I was telling him, had I checked his rating before, we wouldn't e gm be having this convo... the wash and dry was good BUT Brett needs some serious customer service skill training! Will never return so the free cart wash was a mute point",Negative
"How does this place stay in business? 12 minutes to get checked in, another 10 before they started vacuuming. After nearly 35 minutes, my car was finally heading towards the wash. Once it went through the tunnel, it sat outside unattended with the engine running for 15 minutes. It was out there long enough for the spot free rinse to dry and leave water spots. Having already paid inside for the wash, I got in it and drove it around to where the free vacuum was. I walked over and I tried to talk to an attendant who then called for ""Mike"". Not seeing Mike right away, I walked inside and as he was walking out. I handed him my receipt and told him that I just simply didn't have anymore time to wait. I then walked back to where the vacuums were and proceeded to wipe my own car down. Mostly unsupervised and unmotivated employees. This is the slowest car wash I have ever been to in my life.",Negative
"One of the associates there stole a pair of $200 prescription glasses (that I require in order to drive) out of my console. I have been calling and leaving messages all day to no avail. If you plan to go there then please do not leave anything behind since they don't care if their employees are thieves. They also run a ""window repair scam"". Every car that pulls up seems to have a magical window chip that wasn't there before that they offer to fix at no charge. They didn't realize they pulled the same scripted scam on me twice so far. I will be filing a claim on my glasses and contacting corporate.",Negative
"BEWARE of SCAM!! Please do not get your car washed or auto detailed here because they do not do a good job. We asked for a hand wash and they didn't do it. They also left our car with dirt on the windshield and dirt still in the car. The main reason I'd advise against coming here is because there is a guy named a Anthony (with bald head and tattoos all over from head to toe) who tried to rip my mom and I off with our insurance. He said there was a chip on our windshield, and that if we didn't get it fixed, it would spread in the summer. He asked for our insurance and said our insurance would cover it. We called our insurance and basically, this guy turned out to be a scam. We asked if we could see the chip on the windshield again, and he was upset and replied ""I already showed it to you!"" He was also lurking around during our phone conversation with our insurance and made us feel very uncomfortable to say the least. He was really angry when we told him we didn't want him to work on our windshield and he stormed off and said it was too late. He said that it had already been ""processed"" and they already ""fixed"" our windshield. However, when we asked one of the attendees, he told us nothing was done to our car, all they did was clean it. All in all, this was a VERY BAD place to come and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We called our insurance and they said that guy had already put a claim on our windshield ""chip"", so we told them about what happened so that they knew it was a scam.",Negative
"I like this car wash. They always do a nice job on my car, remember the kind of wash I had previously, and the staff are very pleasant. There are guys who ask to repair chips in your windshield, but I've never had a problem with politely declining them.",Positive
Absolutely best car wash in Nevada!! Washed my car and it rained the very next day...spoke to the manager and he told me bring it right in my people will take care of you..and they did!! I will be definitely only taking my car here! Thank you again!,Positive
This is the 1st and last time I will ever come to this car wash. The cashier inside let me know the price I informed her that I was a lift driver and on the web site there was 10% discount. She said do I have the Id? Or application I couldn't understand her because her English was not to good. I said all I have is the sticker on the car. I said the guy outside did see it. She said am I outside? At this point I was like what do you want me to do take a picture of the sticker? She said no you are rude I will do for you. I just didn't understand that she meant my app on my phone because at no point did she ever reference that. Still there was no need to call a paying customer rude. That is why this place has low ratings very sad.,Negative
"I've been coming here for years because it is convenient. They should bring back the old management. The new management doesn't seem to care and I've tried reasoning with them. Rule #1: If they look busy just drive on by... It will take over an hour, I only stop when I see guys standing around. #2 The new crew will clean it up nice if you stand by your car and point out what needs to be addressed. (under previous management that wasn't necessary) #3 They will not let you use a gift card if you have a coupon or any kind if discount. (go figure)",Negative
"First i am so sick of the auto glass people chasing me down everytime i go there. This trip when I took my car in it was done in 15 mins. Faster then I thought it would be. When I got in my car I found out why. It looked like crap. Like they did nothing to clean my car. I had to wipe down my dash board myself. I turned around and came back. The guy that had done the inside of my car was quite mad that I said it looked like crap. I asked why the attitude and he told me ""you gave me attitude first so I'm going to give you attitude"" the manager actually had to stand in between us. I thought I was going to have to defend myself. I was just thinking ""is this guy really going to hit a woman?"" They corrected all the issues I had with the job they did. But that guy totally lost a customer for them.",Negative
My car needed a deep cleaning and I am so glad I brought it here. They quoted me 1 1/2 hours and kept to it. My car has never looked better. I will definitely be back!,Positive
"Worst car wash in Nevada!! Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. I never do reviews, but I couldn't in good conscious not report how bad my experience at this place was. The guy hassling you to fix your chip on your window is definitely running a scam. I said no thank you..and after I got my new car back it had a 3/4 crack over the whole windshield...they said it happen because I didn't let them fix my crack. Of course the manager said they are NOT responsible and they did a horrible job on my car....never again will I step foot in that place and you shouldn't either..trust me you will thank me for this warning.",Negative
"The carwash itself was ok, nothing out of the ordinary. I had to ask for a rag to clean for some missed spots. The major issues I had were te following: 1. As soon as I got there, one of the employees pointed out the marks on the glass because ""it probably got hit with a rock or something."" He then offered to ""fix"" it for free if I had full-coverage insurance. Luckily, my friend who used to work for an insurance company warned me and told me that is a scam and that I would later get billed by my insurance company and this would be treated as a claim. 2. When I was cleaning the missed spots I leaned over to the passenger's side and one of the employees said in Spanish how cute the thin girl (me) is in what I considered an inappropriate tone! I am fluent in Spanish and he didn't know that. I demanded respect and he apologized saying he just meant I was pretty. That's definitely how I interpreted things. It made me uncomfortable and I'm definitely never going back here!",Negative
"After years of going there every week today will be my last time. It's been declining for a while, I usually bring my truck home and touch it up to my expectations. Last straw is the new ticket writer the one who call everybody boss. Brought it in on a rain check and got the worst wash ever, I was so mad all I could muster to him was that was the last time I'm going over there. Hope the owners kid who now runs the place can right the ship..... Good luck son",Negative
"This used to be our go-to car wash...it WAS the best in the valley. No more. Since the change in management service and quality rapidly declined while prices escalate. There are water marks all over the car after delivery. Windows are smeared and blurry. Seats do not feel clean. The vacuum job is very poor. We keep hoping it will get better, but each wash is worse. Mother coupons used to be a great deal, but now they are horrible. The windshield repair people are rude and aggressive and take offense when you turn them down. No one tells you which lane to pull in and the ticket writer is rude and abrasive. The cashier barely speaks English. The workers are rude and curt when you pick up your car. Today they had a carpet dryer blowing in the store and it was freezing, the wind is blowing and its cold outside and it's freezing inside and just as windy. I took photos of my car today and the manager ran over to see what was wrong and said he would fix it. The lady came back over very upset that she had to fix the car. Water streaks everywhere, outer door handles grimy, dead bugs still on the grill, bumper and fenders. Horrible job. We will not be back. Green valley Hand Car Wash is no longer...it is a rip-off.",Negative
Let me just start this by saying I have been bringing cars here for 5 years... The service has been heading downhill for awhile. Today was the last time I'll ever bring a vehicle here. It has taken a few bad experiences here for me to write this review. Ever since new management or new owners took over its been a horrible place to go. They upped the prices. Which isnt the worst thing ever. That kind of stuff happens. When the work is good thats ok. But the prices went up and the quality of work went down. Today 9-11-15 was the absolute worst experience. The ticket writer should probably be washing cars and not dealing with customers. I think he assumed I couldn't read. So he hands me a ticket before even asking what I really wanted with a 75 dollar price written on it. Right behind him is a big sign of services that says Dually trucks are 45 dollars for silver service. So I asked him about that and thru the herpes on his mouth he says that's for small dually trucks. So I asked him if my truck wasn't a small dually he said it was but the 45 dollars was for outside wash only. Still to this point he still hasn't asked me what I wanted. He marked wax on my ticket. I asked him about that and he says oh no thats 180 to wax this truck. So why is it marked on my ticket? I told him that a dually truck 2 weeks ago was only 60 for the exact same services he's telling me I'm getting today. He said well that was 2 weeks ago. As we left him and his buddies were staring us down. Well its the last time he'll see me or any of my company trucks that we've had washed there for years.,Negative
"Just wanted to say how disappointed I am with this car wash. Last 3 times I took my truck here the employees did a terrible job. They even charge you a $5 over size fee for a truck. Yet they STILL do not do a good job. Exterior has dirty wipe marks. Interior has dust on the dash board, smudge marks on the windshield, dirt on the floorboards and seats left. Honestly I don't know how they are still in business. I wish I could go to them on a regular basis but they fail every time. I've even talked to the manager about it and they re washed my truck. But, why wait to have my truck washed twice? Get it right the first time. Completely unprofessional",Negative
"From the moment we pulled up some punk kept trying to say we had chips in our windshield and I said ok. Then while I was telling the other guy we wanted the $20 wash the punk kept telling us about the free chip repair and I said it's ok just a wash today. Then he said ""it's FREE"" and I replied now why would you do that for FREE? He said we do and ask me ""you have full coverage insurance don't you?"" I said what business is it of yours what kind of insurance I have and what does this have to do with a car wash? Read my lips ""NO""and walked away pissed. We won't be back. First and last visit. The guy who cleaned and dried the car did an amazing job. Tipped him and because of him 2 stars. Another thing ""tacky"" or another scam there is a box hand written on the counter asking for donations. People!!!! Give donations to a bank fund.",Negative
"Super aggressive sales. It wasn't that way a year ago but it is now. I moved away for a year and came back now it's way different. I used to get the same $20 gold service to have my car cleaned and vacuumed. I have a dog that sheds a lot so it's nice. This time, my first time back in a year, the guy tried to sell a $60 car wash including shampoo. I politely declined. His eyes widened like he was trying to tell me through facial expression that I was retarded for declining is offer for a $60 car wash.... Then he tells me the dog hair will only come out with a shampoo. I just declined and asked for the $20 car wash because I always got it before and it was perfect. Keeping In mind I have the same dog I figured id get the same wash I always got. When they were done. Hair was barely touched. I drove away with hair still flying in my mouth. Car was coated in it. I guess that was my punishment? Some rock solid customer service if I do say so myself. Secondly. These side guys ALWAYS find ""chip damage"" in your windshield. Always offer your insurance to pay for it. They always find it. I did it every once in a while before but if I said ""no"" they dropped it. Maybe one more ""are you sure?"" But that was it. This time.... I had to say ""No"" 8 times. I was trying to be polite. Around the 6th ""no"" I wanted to slap him in the eyeballs with a rag coated in tiger balm. I had to start walking away as he walked with me and continued to ask me about the chip repair. They have this super aggressive new sales tactic and I super hate it. Won't be going back. Maybe some people love that, if you like being hassled to the point I could comfortably call harassment, then consider this a 5 star car wash. Otherwise, just go somewhere else. These people will make you super irritated that you just gave them money to harass you... And punish you with crap service if you don't buy the better package they want to push on you.",Negative
"WOW WOW WOW HOW DOES THIS PLACE STAY IN BUSINESS? My car went through the wash and then they parked it in the sun, it's been sitting for 10 min. I go and look for the manager, his name is Sal (short haired Sal,) he is inside but a sack of Takis and when I ask him to ""kindly explain why my car is sitting in the sun washed and no one is drying it? He shoves a Taki in his mouth, and sends me to the manager Sal with the long hair, he is short tempered, he came out of the office to find out, ""what my problem is."" My problem is this place and the poor service... The window chipped guy at the front, Blake is awesome! Before the service was bad, now under new management and the service remains to be not good... The massage chairs inside are awesome! How difficult really is it to provide great service, be competent and not have to sit here on this bench listening to other unhappy patrons... Wake up Green Valley Car Wash!!! I have been coming here since the day you opened- not again. Errrrr!!! The man who dried my car, so so sweet, from Cuba- nice, kind soul.",Negative
"Felt really rushed. They try and upsell you on chip repair and have you call your insurance company and talk on the phone for 15 mins figuring it out. They missed a lot of chips on both cars that I had done. Couldn't figure out who to get the keys from afterwards. Very unorganized place. Also the cars weren't cleaned very well. I don't normally write reviews, but had to warn people not to go here. Go somewhere else.",Negative
A attendant recklessly scratched up my car using pliers to remove the exterior antenna. Who does that? Avoid this place at all costs.,Negative
"Not good. First, beware of the scammer who's gonna greet you and ask you if you were interested in fixing ""the chips' on your windshield. Then, are you interested in paying +$15 for a car wash that doesn't bother cleaning your cup holder or empty your car's ashtray? Lastly, even their express car wash machine is terrible. It left deep scratches and swirls on my car. The owners should save their dignity and close this place or consider giving customers better service.",Negative
"I have been coming to this place for my car washes for the last 5years. Today I was very surprised how rude this manager ""Chris"". I would NOT recommend anyone to come here. There are plenty of friendlier car washes in the Vegas valley! ( he said I don't know my math, when I only wanted to buy a package: 3-gold wash get 3 free and refund the cashier charged me $14.95. I told him I want to use one of six-gold from my package today ($10.50) and I want $14.95 refund, this ""Chris"" said he cannot refund. To me it's pretty simple: sell me the package, refund the $14.95, and use one of the ticket for this wash. There's no math involved and there is no need to be rude unless a customer is cursing at you. I would never set foot here again nor I would recommend anyone.....",Negative
"I have been going here for years. Last week I was told I must remove my trailer hitch because it can ""damage the tunnel."" Their explanation was nonsensical. Removing my hitch is a hassle. I won't be going back. Ever.",Negative
"Argued with guy about price- on the phone then in the store. If you don't want to give the discount then don't advertise it on your site. Got the complete detail job. Came home and realized- footprint still on back of one of my seats, didn't wipe my cup holders and surrounding area, side windows were barely touched. Family members had similar issues with place previously, apparently. Not going back. I'll give my free wash (that I got with package) to someone else.",Negative
"Never been to that car wash, but had a gift card for it. I purchased the silver package($15), just an outside wash,with tire dressing, no wax. I prefer to clean the interior of the car myself as I do not like certain interior cleaners and protectors (Armour All). Silver package did not mention cleaning inside the vehicle, but my car came back with the interior vacuumed and wiped down. Car was washed and dried quickly, did not take more than 30 mins even with 3 or 4 cars ahead of me. Nothing exciting to report except I think it was a little too pricey for an exterior wash. I 'll go back again to use up the gift card, but I have a guy that comes to my house who washes, hand dry, hand wax and cleans the interior for $25 +$5 tip......waaaaaay better!",Negative
"I have had a very negative experience with HondaWest service department. I took it in for B service, and was told I had one tire that was not the same as the other 3. It was a smaller size and different brand. Further, the problem was made worse when I stopped in a Honda dealership in the SE (Heritage Honda) and the technicians there tightened and torqued the tire - I am in shock that the Honda technician did not notice the tire was different than the others. The quote Honda West provided was $988 to get two new tires, a full new rim, new battery and the service check-up. I investigated what went wrong and discovered my mom had my other tire. I called and asked if it would be possible to switch the tires for me so I could have access to my car over the long weekend. Nikki Kjinserdahl told me that the technicians were ""too busy"" to switch the tires for me and that they would not ""service two vehicles"" that day. She was also trying to tell me that new tires may be required etc etc. I wasn't asking for service on two cars, I was simply asking to switch over the correct tire so I could drive safely. I proceeded to take my car down the street to Canadian Tire and the Canadian Tire technicians helped us right away. They said it was a simple problem with a simple solution of switching the tires. I did NOT need a new tire whatsoever, and all I had to do was purchase new lug nuts. The total cost was $35. I will never come to Honda West again, as Nikki told me I would not be safe to drive, but refused to help me. I was put in a position where I was forced to go somewhere else, down the road, to receive assistance from technicians. Go to Canadian Tire instead to deal with your tire needs. I won't be coming to Honda West for service again.",Negative
"Honda West is awesome. My last four cars came from here. All four were serviced here regularly. Jocelyn Barton, the fleet manager, is a wonderful, friendly person. She understands the importance of good service. She also understands the importance of excellent reviews and does not hesitate to respond in kind.",Positive
"These guys cruise Kijiji ads looking for used cars to make offers on so they can resell them on their lot. They called me and said they were interested in my car I told them not to waste my time if they were going to lowball me. They said they wouldn't and that they would offer a competitive price they then contacted me back found the cheapest car in Canada they could find that had similar kms but is in very poor condition, and then offered me 30% less than what my car was for sale for. So, if they think 30% off is fair on a used car, then I guess they'd think offering 30% off on new cars would also be fair. These guys are snakes and the ultimate bottom feeders of used car salesmen, cruising Kijiji ads to resell cars on their lot. Buyer beware.",Negative
"I have a 2008 Honda Civic, so I can't give a recent review about the dealership. The service department is helpful and efficient; I haven't had a problem with issues like paying for unnecessary repairs (unlike Crowfoot Honda). The mechanics have done a great job of maintaining my car over the years. Their shuttle service is also very good--just make sure you drop off your vehicle early in the day so that they can pick you up before rush hour!",Positive
I own a Honda CR-V and take my car there for service whenever I need it and they are all wonderful! I love the dealership and the service department. Will enjoy dealing with them for years to come!,Positive
"Like most of reviewers here, I have mixed feelings about Honda west. I bought my first Honda in 2012 from here. It was not so much about the dealership, but I simply fell in love with the 08 accord coupe when I saw it. From the very beginning I felt like I was just another custom, and nothing they did really made me feel like they appreciate my investment (let's face it there are dealerships hungry with sales reps trying to meet their quota, and go to far extent to make the sale) I love my car and the experience so far. The service here is alright. Some days the person on the other end of the desk is awesome, like Justin...somedays it feels like I'm talking to a cyborg). Most of the times they have forgotten to give me my free car wash ticket. Not to be picky but if you are paying close to $300 every 4-5 months, that's just a nice gesture. No in facility car wash, so you have to take it to the local car wash and give them the coupon for a BASIC car wash. No shuttle service on the weekend, so if your friend is not picking you up....be prepended to sit down for a while. For now I guess I'll have to make it work. I'll look into other Honda dealership. Will I buy another Honda from Honda west? Prolly not.",Positive
I had a good experience buying my car. Gabe in finance was amazing. Service department was very helpful when I got a flat and needed a tire replaced. They got me in as soon as they could and were very patient. The only problem I have with honda is their loan department. They messed up my bank information when they entered it in the system and blamed it on me when I was behind a payment because of their stupidity. Then they called me and I had no clue what was going on until he tore me a new one. They treated me very unprofessionally. I've never been talked to with so much disrespect. If you do not like working in customer service then don't and don't take your mistakes out on me.,Negative
I agree with the previous review. We were at the dealership this week and our trade in vehicle was appraised so low that we ended up leaving without buying. We went to Airdrie. Better service and better price. Shop around.,Negative
This Honda dealer has given me bad service on more than one occasion. After writing to management several times with no response this dealer is one of the reasons i am selling my Honda,Negative
"I find it hard to give 1 star. I was shopping for a QX60 and the experience is pathetic I've never met any such un professional sales staff. The sales person has no idea of what am asking or any knowledge of vehicle The most flabbergasting thing was, the person disappeared during the conversation for more than 30 min and came back drunk. Is this a showroom or a bar. Above all it's a total waste of my 2 hours, they deny what they posted on their website and it was pretty funny that I was told there is no car that can be leased for less than 680 USD. I started walking out and suddenly another salesman comes out as a bully Guys my serious advice, get your act together if you want to run the business. You need to earn the business and above that respect customer I will never recommend this dealership and will even share with my biggest community and help them to stay away from this.",Negative
"Being Involved in the Technology Business sector for the past 40 years, one witnesses patterns develop. Fluctuations of an industries goods and services, are inevitable, as it is in life in general. Although there are exceptions where fluctuations are anticipated and embraced in a positive manner, simply said the ones committed to integrity will compete honestly and thoroughly to produce the long term favorable constant. Scottsdale Infiniti Service Departments representative Eric has proven a reflection of the aforementioned integrity. I have witnessed his ability to interact seamlessly (listen and explain) with a wide range of customers, including the members on his team. Although to understand an electric-mechanical system requires a skill, interacting with all the facets involved in an industry requires much more for long term success. It does take aptitude, attitude, experience and skill, but most importantly is the integrity with which this package functions. To find a product and repair shop one can trust is truly valuable. Worth mentioning is the 2012 Infiniti I own which has been serviced strictly by Scottsdale Infiniti for the past 5 years. I currently receive compliments and offers to purchase this vehicle from a wide range of people rather often due to its current condition. Automobile technician groups need brand specific specialization these days. Just training, certificates and factory authorization are not guarantees of workmanship. A well seasoned technician knows that experience, training and intelligence are not a guarantee for outcome; again.... there needs to be integrity and attitude in the environment. All personnel on particular team in a professional environment of respect and positive energy flow, will then provide the best steady positive results. All the experience in the world cannot thrive properly without these ingredients and good moral character. Outcome of this nature reflects this department. Thank you,",Positive
"I purchased my wife's q50 about a year ago. It was used with about 26,000 miles. I have to say that the buying experience was great. It was hassle free and relatively quick compared to other dealerships. Here's the rub. A coupe of weeks ago we got a flat tire in the middle of nowhere on the way to New Mexico. No worries. I can put on the spare and get the tire replaced. Not so fast. There was no spare or even a jack. I was perplexed. I have never purchased a car that didn't include a spare tire or a jack. It never even dawned on me to check. In hindsight, I should have checked. I took it for granted. Needless to say, we had to call for help. I sent an email to the dealer a few days later and received a call from the sales manager. The conversation was brief. I was told the car came with run flat tires that will go about 50 miles and that the spare tire is an upgrade option. I was never told this. The sales manager was sure he mentioned it to me. I can assure you he did not. I was also told it would cost $2000 to add the package or I could just buy a spare myself and put it in the trunk. Those are my options. Ok. I can promise you infinity of Scottsdale will not get $2000 more from me. The general manager did reach out also, but again, no real resolution. Just because of my experience I wouldn't recommend using this dealership to friends or family. How do you sell a car without a spare tire or a jack and not tell the purchaser? Not everyone has AAA.",Negative
"This dealer is by far the worst I have ever encounter. The employees in the service department and sales floor are un-professional and I honestly believe they need a better service manager with new technicians. I have taken my car to get service 5 times for the same issue and they could never give me an answer it was always a run around and then I had a salesman on the floor flirt with my wife while I was going to get my keys lol comical but so disrespectful. However, I found a home in inifiniti of Peoria were I was satisfied with the service and was told exactly what was going wrong with my new vehicle..",Negative
I shopped at at about 4 different Infiniti dealers in the valley last year before I leased my Q50. By far Infiniti of Scottsdale was the best! Then a year later after careful concideration I decided to work here because of the professionalism they showed during my car buying process. I can't be more thrilled to work anywhere else and I love my Q50!,Positive
"I recently moved to Arizona and am starting from scratch as I sold all my possessions in California. I drove a big SUV and was ready to purchase a more fuel efficient car but didn't want to sacrifice performance. I'm not one to go to the first dealer and get pressured into buying anything so I spent the greater part of 2 months searching for cars in the valley shopping around. I've read and heard great consumer reviews on Infiniti and have been eyeing the new and beautiful Infiniti Q50 hybrid and saw one online that I wanted to check out at Infiniti of Scottsdale. After a few minutes of walking in on the lot, I was greeted by a nice and welcoming sales rep by the name of Nic. He was extremely helpful as I was asking a lot of questions. His sales manager Amir also greeted me and answered some questions since he also drives the same car (not the hybrid) and told me the features and benefits of the vehicle. At NO point in our conversation did I feel that I was being pressured to buy this car and felt very comfortable with our interactions. I ended up taking the car for a test drive and immediately fell in love. The ride is smooth, great performance and gets great gas mileage. We worked out the numbers and found a comfortable payment with great terms. I couldn't be happier with my decision and will recommend this dealership to anyone I meet who's in the market for a car. Thank you Amir and Nic for making my purchase easy and smooth. You found yourselves a new loyal customer in a new city.",Positive
"Jose gave me a free estimate that was only a fraction of the price of service king. I admit, I was a little nervous thinking it wouldn't be as good of a job. But this guy is seriously awesome! Very friendly and professional. Did a few extra touch ups from what I originally asked for (pleasant surprise) and included it in his original estimate. He finished 3 days before his original time frame. I'm very pleased with his work, and will refer anyone! Here's some pictures. All the photos on the left side are when I was hit, and the photos on the right side are after JC collisions. Thanks again, Jose! Beautiful work.",Positive
AMAZING SHOP!!!! Thanks Jose!!! I got pushed into the side of the road by some jerk. I live three hours away and Jose fixed my car for me right there on the spot. I can't thank you enough. I will definitely tell everybody about your business. There should be more businesses like you out there.you guys have a great year!!!,Positive
"thoroughly happy with the customer care we received...leather couches in the waiting room was nice, free water, even nicer... when i used the restroom i snuck a peek at some custom paint jobs there were doing (impressive to say the least). Once i hear the price i couldn't say no. when we came back for the car the next day it looked like a brand new vehicle. I cannot say enough how gracious and friendly the staff was. We highly recommend JC Collision.",Positive
I rear ended someone couple weeks back. All I had to do is send tow truck driver picked up my vehicle dropped it off at shop and Jose got it all squared away for me..Awesome owner prompt service happy customer ..thank you for the great service -John G,Positive
"Need honest, fast, and awesome work done after your vehicle has been damage? This shop is the place to bring It to. Not only did they give me excellent customer service and notified me every step of the way. They also had my car complete back on the road and looking like nothing happened to It in a matter of days.. good as new! They worked with my Insurance and got me on the road in no time. Thanx JC Collison I will recommended your shop to anyone that is in need of your services!",Positive
Well... well... well .. as I promised people. . Here's the up date about my car totally done right as JC promised. . And yes !!! Looks like new im very grateful Jose.. thanks guys,Positive
"I received quick, efficient, & friendly service with Adolfo & Erik the other day when I stopped by after work for an oil change. My car is almost 14 years old and they stated I needed an engine flush. They kindly showed me on the insides of my engine having black gunk, which can affect the performance of my car & oil intake after changing it. I will be coming back again for my next oil change or maintenance needs!",Positive
"We have been coming to this location for our oil changes for many years. The best service ever is from George B. He always remembers our family and makes suggestions that are very positive for the ""health"" of our vehicles. This location is very efficient and you are in and out in no time. Thanks George for making a necessary but mundane task (oil changes etc), into a very positive experience. We advise all of our friends in family to use this location! We will never take our cars anywhere else.",Positive
"I've been too many jiffy lubes in my life and this is by far my favorite one. They're always fast, friendly, and dependable",Positive
Had a great experience at this Jiffy Lube location. Arrived near closing and were given expert and thorough service. Careful attention paid to our vehicle's service history and needs is appreciated as well as no push for unneeded work. Orlando was especially kind and patient. Thanks for your honesty and efficiency!,Positive
"These guys work quick and fast, and are always willing to work with you for discount. George is a great help and manager. I highly recommend them!",Positive
"I took my car in on October 16th for an oil change and was told that while I was there you could change my brake pads for me as well as I needed this done. I paid $352.11 for the brake pads and $124.98 for the oil change. The employees of course never told me that they only did the front brakes, but when I got home my car told me. I called in and they said they'd order the rear brakes as well for me. I took the car back in on October 26 to have the rear brake pads changed. When I took the car home after that, the warning sign for brakes wouldn't reset and it said the parking brake had been damaged. The brakes began acting sluggish and had to be pushed clear to the floor to slow down. I called the location and they told me to take it to bmw. I took it in today where I was charged $179 for the diagnostic. Upon inspection they told me that whoever changed the brakes had missed a bolt, put one bolt in the wrong place, and had not even attached the pads properly. This has caused brake fluid to leak into the pads, damaged the brakes themselves, and the car should never have been driven in that condition as the brakes weren't even functioning. Thank god I didn't crash due to the employees negligence or incompetence not sure which at this point. It will cost $2700+ to get the car fixed properly by bmw and I do not want their people working on this anymore; but they told me the only thing that they can do is to take the car back to their shop and look at It themselves. They've made 0 offers to reimburse me for the ""services"" that I had done here. I submitted a complaint to corporate last Friday and have only receiving one email from jiffy lube basically just trying to make sure they have no liability by blaming this on the owner, who has not reached out once. DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE FOR ANY REASON!! It is worth driving a few minutes further to at least have a car!!!!! My car has been un-driveable for 2 WEEKS now and they've made 0 effort to compensate me for my losses or time lost. Will be reporting to BBB, AG, and every single website that I can possibly find.",Negative
Great fast service. And they do military discount! Stop by if you're in the area. You get free vacuum and they check all the fluids,Positive
Not all Jiffy Lube locations are created equal. This location is at the top. I've been to this one multiple times over the last few years. The most recent visit was for a last minute smog check. They were very kind and efficient in their service. I appreciate businesses like this and am grateful this is so close to my house.,Positive
"OIL CHANGE COST ME HUNDREDS...I went in for an oil change and air in my truck tires before my Labor Day vacation. The CSA was very friendly and the tech said my battery was ""bad"" according to the screen he showed me. I agreed to a new 3-year battery, but as I was driving away, I noticed that my fan was on high and blowing hot air, my A/C would not turn on and the tire pressure light was still on. I came back, they put air in the tires (!?!) and tried another battery so that my A/C would work. No luck, and almost three hours later, I had to make a run to the dealer to see if they could help me stop the HOT air blowing and get my A/C working again. They could, with a repair of over $500 once the part arrives on Tuesday the 6th. My vacation had to be cancelled because I can't drive in 100 degrees with no A/C and my ""oil change"" visit cost me the $200 at Jiffy Lube and over $500 at the dealer when the part arrives. My biggest disappointment - after missing out on my first vacation in a year - is the lack of response from the manager. I get that things happen and dealing with an unhappy customer is never fun, but I've been calm in explaining the situation, and now, I can't even get anyone to answer the phone.",Negative
"Worst service at an expensive price. Every time I bring in my car for oil change, they increase the price by $15 and reduce the time of work by 10 minutes. A total scam business by the people running this store. Never returning back and do not recommend anyone else. It's cheaper to get it done at dealership or even Wal-Mart who will stick to their prices. Worst thing is, you ask them to print your old receipts and see the price, they say their computers aren't in good shape and are running slow. When you show them the old receipts, heck we do not honor the same price. Full of shit place and employees not even trustworthy and friendly.",Negative
"I come here to get all my cars (we have 3) done for over 10 yrs and these no matter who the personel has akways been very good. Just today went early when they first open and Charles got me in and out in no time. 5 yrs earlier my car need its breaks fixed and Charles (same guy) got them done right. It did take a little longer, but after Charles got do e with them, to this day still work very well..highly recommend! thx Charles for doing a great job!",Positive
"Came in today to have the coolant changed in my truck. Was quoted $109+ tax. At the end, they charged me about $135. They charged extra because a pickup truck holds more coolant than a small car. Most chains do this and I think it's a deceptive business practice. The guy who quoted me the price was the manager. He knows it costs extra on a truck, but still quotes the lower car price. When he was ringing me up, I said ""You should mention that when you quote someone their price."" He said absolutely nothing, hit a few more buttons on the keyboard, then told me to swipe my card. That was it. They also didn't go through their normal checklist of washing the windows, checking other fluids, vacuuming the floor, etc. that Jiffy Lube is known for. It's not the money, it's the principle and top it off with poor customer service. Thumbs down. They were pretty quick, that's the best I can say.",Negative
"went in for an oil change... $79.99... out the door $108.00. 79.99 only covers 5 qts?? $10.99 for an extra quart? the finest racing oil is that price... pulls the air filters that are perfectly good.. trying to tell me they are bad. untrustworthy business... pulled my personal items out of the glove box and did not put back.. these guys are scam artist... 5 quarts of Mobil 1 is $25 at any part store....* side note; 5 days later when my battery died on my car, i popped the hood to change the battery and i find that at all of my plastic clips are missing from my engine cover ...",Negative
"Wow! You want to talk about great customer service? These guys right here. Seriously. Charles, in particular, has been awesome. Each time my car has had an issue, he has explained what it is and what the best solution would be. I've brought my wife's car here for an oil change, my car for an oil change, and my car again for an issue with my radiator. Every time these guys were awesome. And not just to me, either. I've overheard their conversations with other customers and they've been just as great with them, too. We just recently moved to Vegas from LA, so I'm very happy to have found an honest mechanic so quickly.",Positive
"Honest, professional and courteous service. Highly recommend! Jim is the best. I will be returning to this Jiffy Lube location.",Positive
"Richard and Bryce were very kind, courteous, and helpful. I love Jiffy Lube! I did not feel pressured to buy anything more than my oil change but wanted to show my car some extra TLC today-they helped point me in the right direction of what was important to replace and what could be done next time. Prices are accurate and fair. I arrived here at 3:30 pm and was gone in about an hour. Oil change, tire rotation, engine flush, and antifreeze top off. Very efficient service and I appreciate hard work with a smile.",Positive
"I have had a pleasant experience every time at this location. I have been taken care of quickly, efficiently, and with a smile. These guys are extremely friendly, and always explain in detail, what services were provided. I would recommend them in a heartbeat! A+ service",Positive
"I always trust the guys at this location because of the customer service rendered to me. They are true professionals and honest with their work. The prices are comparable to anywhere else, but the true value is in having peace of mind!",Positive
"What a rip! First, I have a coolant leak after another Jiffy Lube insisted I needed my radiator flushed, which I did even though I just got the new radiator a year before and told them that. They showed me a tube with merky water in it and so I did it...don't remember the cost but well over $100. I tell them that I have a coolant leak and a transmission leak that I just noticed and I'd like my oil changed. I also asked them not to put 6 qts of oil in my vehicle because it shows over the safe line when they do...the dip stick says right on it ""do not over fill"". First they try to sell me a transmission flush (I had that done 1.5 years ago and told them didn't they notice the leak and I needed to find out what that was first. He acts like I said nothing about leaks or overfilling my oil. It's been awhile and I go out and ask them if they put 5.5 qts as I requested and the manager goes over and pulls the stick while telling me they put 6 in and it was just fine. I ask to see the stick and it is over the safe line and ask them to remove some. He's annoyed and says it looks just fine. Within a few minutes this guy comes in and says it's done. Of course it's $70+ for an oil change and I ask about the coolant leak. He says there wasn't one which I clearly saw a couple times happening and also saw coolant on my garage floor under the radiator. The color was yellowish but he claims nothing. The transmission they claim is a plug and need a new gasket (which was replaced already). Bottom line....enough of Jiffy Lubes. I now am going to an auto repair shop to find out why my vehicle has two leaks and what they are. Their attitudes were unfriendly and yet when I went to get into my vehicle they were all standing together and all smiles and laughing....makes me wonder what else I will find now.",Negative
"I went to jiffy Lube because of horrible customer service I have had at other places. when I went there it was my first time not to long ago and a man Richard was helping me. He was so friendly and actually didn't just tell but showed me how low my battery was. I believed him and I got a new battery. After his helpfulness, we went inside and he suggested a few things. (I was leaving on vacation) I bought everything he recommended. what a great knowledgeable staff. I would recommend this to anyone!",Positive
After only a few days from my review I was contacted by Jiffy Lube. They sincerely wanted to know about my service. I was able to recall the situation and tell them my frustrations. He pointed out that my bill wasn't all from the oil change because I got a new cabin air filter which was $50. The jiffy lube guy offered a discount for my next visit.,Positive
"If you want a Quick No Fuss Oil Change, or get your Fluids Changed, or Filled..Come to this Jiffy Lube Location. It's on the Corner of Windmill & Pecos... It seems smaller than most Jiffy Lube Locations, but they are Very Good at what they do! I was In, and Out of there in Less than an Hour ( 30 Minutes, Tops). The Manager is Awesome, He is From Hawaii, and in My Case...He did give me a Discount on Some things that I Needed to Change! I know this Review is a Little Short, but what else can I say...but, this Review was made in a JIFFY, LOL!",Positive
"So, first I will say that I had a very very very long wait. But still giving them 4 stars for how nice they were and how they went above and beyond for making me wait. I arrived at 12:45PM-- they told me about 30 minute wait, and then 10-15 minutes to change my oil after. I waited more than 30 minutes, but whatever.. When they looked over my car I also ended up getting transmission fluid. When they thought they were done they told me 10 more minutes (2PM at this point). Well they had to fix something with the drain, so another 15 but they offered to drive me back to work, but I declined. Then about 15-20 minutes later, they came out again saying something about my drainage cap or thread weren't working, and they needed a piece from a different Jiffy Lube location. They said it would take a while longer, and they offered to take me to work again. This time I couldn't refuse. I was a little skeptical, but I needed to get to work after being there for hours. They drove me to work a few miles away, and the tech was apologizing the whole ride. The things wrong were not an extra charge, but just something unexpected are their end. A little over an hour after they dropped me off at work, they dropped my car off and left the keys with the front desk. Nothing was missing, everything was there. They gave me $15 off coupon for the unexpected wait, and vacuumed my floor mats. They were very nice and did a great job. Thanks for trying to make your problems not my worry.",Positive
"Said it might take an hour but I was okay with the wait with how much I need to get done, but was out of there in 30 mins ! Very effective and polite, they really take care of veterans which is appreciated. I thought I would need my brake pads changed but they didn't try to rip me off like most places would, they said they were fine as well as other things I had concerns about!",Positive
"I have been coming to this Jiffy Lube since I moved to Vegas last year. The employees are always very friendly and look you in the eye, I appreciate that a lot. The last time I got the oil changed, I was very impressed with the service but they messed up the windows of my soft top when they tried using a cleaner and rag to clean them (big no-no for any type of soft top vehicle). I got one of those surveys after my service that time, and I mentioned the windows in my comments. Not only did the manager personally call me to ask about the situation and offer to rectify it, but the district manager was also involved with it. So today was when I had a day off for my next oil change a few months later! The service was fantastic as always, and there was no trouble with my windows or anything else. I really appreciated them doing a great job with my beloved Jeep.",Positive
"I have been taking my car to this Jiffy Lube for oil changes and smog checks for the last three years or so. They have always been reliable and efficient. The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating. They are on the pricier side when it comes to oil change, but they do give you several options/packages to choose from. They also wash your car windows and vacuum the floors, check fluids/top off if needed along with an oil change. They will try and upsell for sure. Main upsell point is the air filter...unless you've never changed it, it is a negligible thing that really won't make much difference in your gas mileage, and is something you can do yourself. Overall, they aren't pushy with the upsells, when you say you are not interested it's left at that. I have not had any issues in years of dealing with them.",Positive
"Saw the guy on the street waiving the sign for a oil change, knew I needed one, but was short on time. I pulled in and asked how long it would take. Twenty minutes and I was out! Great customer service as the others have mentioned. The best thing was that that they topped off all my fluids & didn't charge me extra for the oil as my engine takes more than normal. I' ll be taking the other four of our family's cars back there for oil changes for sure!",Positive
"Very, very, very friendly employees...but they left greasy fingerprints ALL over my pickups exterior. My windows they ""cleaned""...holy crap I almost wreck when the sun hit the windshield and the streaks came into full reflective view. They should have used the windshield rag to clean there hands before working on any ones vehicle and then use a squeegee to do the windows..if the homeless figured this out how come a major chain operation hasn't...use a SQUEEGEE. I have been using jiffy lube for years (other store locations) and this is the first time I have experienced these issues.",Negative
"So, I have never had to take my car in to get anything done in the last 4 years that I have had it because I use to date a guy who worked for Toyota and he did everything for me. Well, now that he is out of the picture and my check engine light came on, I had to figure out what I needed to fix that. I knew about the last time I had an oil change, but not how many miles. So while I was searching for a place to go, I saw this on Yelp and decided that the reviews were good enough for me. I went on a Sunday about 11:30am and there was not wait. One guy walked up to me as I was getting out of the car and asked me what he could do for me. I liked how he came to me and was very nice right off the bat. He told me how many more miles I had left before I needed an oil change, and it was a little ways off, but I was there and I know the other things needed to be checked so I just went ahead and got an oil change and a filter change, because they discovered it was a bit dirty. I spent $70 because I went for the oil upgrade and they gave me $10 off for some reason. I was not sure why, maybe because it was my first time ever going to a Jiffy Lube, but it was nice. It was worth it because they even vacuumed my car and washed the inside of my windows! That was so nice of them. The three guys that were working were all really nice and very helpful in explaining things to me. I think that all the reviews on here so far are exactly right. I was in and out in 20min and overall my experience was great. No stress, no hassle, just the way I like it.",Positive
"My car has been two weeks overdue of an oil change, but like many others, I procrastinated. At 3:30pm on a Saturday, I bought my car here, seeing that there were 2 cars in line, I don't know if they will service my car. To my surprise, the attendant said that he will squeeze me in. Oh what a relief. I walked over to DQ on a 44 degrees weather to enjoy a turtle pecan cluster and headed back to JL. They did a thorough check on my car, and follow their own checklist to let me know the services that my car may need, but the manager on duty didn't try to push for any added services, which is good. Who likes to be push into a sale right? But of course, comments/advice/tips are definitely welcome, and this was how it went down. I ended up having an oil change and my air filter replaced. Manager on Duty showed me how dirty it was, which I totally agreed upon examining it. The services that day cost me $40 so it was all good. I will always come back to this location to get work done for my car. Also, the soft leather-like chairs are so comfy, but there are only 6 of them. There are magazine for one to read to kill time if one pleases. There are many fast-food joints nearby, such as arby's, del taco, DQ, Weinerschnitzel, Gin Mill (pub)...",Positive
"They straight up lie to you on what oil you ""must have"" and they will use scare tactics to force you to get the full synthetic oil. They will say that you have to get the full synthetic and what your vehicle requires it, when your owners manual says otherwise. They are overpriced for their service. Save yourself some money and go to another shop. DONT TRUST THESE HACKS",Negative
"I cannot say nice enough things about this place. I've consistently been treated well at jiffy lube franchises in this state and others, but this location is phenomenal. I've always been greeted in a super speedy manner and with a smile. That sounds dorky, but when you dread routine errands like getting your oil changed, it's nice to not have to hate this errand quite so much. I've come here a few times to have my oil changed, even my tires rotated and they can put on wiper blades at comparable prices to chain auto parts store! Saves me a trip! The staff is always so, so nice and polite. And willing to help. They've sat and watched me price check other things against competitors before I made a decision. All while being so cool to work with. I'm 34, I've gotten my oil changed since I was 16 in like a million places. Heck my partner can change my oil if I want him to. Nothing compares to how easy, price-amiable, and smooth this location runs. It's came in the other day to just have a simple oil change, needed up with a really cheap tire rotation, they didn't haggle me on upselling a million things I didn't need, and the staff both in the garage and at the desk were so nice. I hate that I have to point that out but at this time of year it's welcome. I'm a jiffy lube girl forever!",Positive
"Been coming to this location for several years, and I've never had a bad experience. They're fast, efficient and professional. Can't ask for more than that!",Positive
This place is so great. The team here is so helpful and informational. Especially the manager Brett. I feel very comfortable with my car in their hands. Getting car stuff done can be stressful and tedious but they make this painless. Thanks to the team at Jiffy Lube on McKnight!,Positive
"This has always been my go to place for fast and friendly oil change/inspection but today I took my car to get inspected at 1:30 in the afternoon and a lady came out to greet me, she told me it would be a couple hours until my car was going to be looked at (which I was ok with since it's my only day off) when I agreed to it a guy screams to her saying ""I told you no more girl"" NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL!!",Negative
"Needed snow tires changed for regular ones I had & a brake check. Everywhere else in the area would've taken 1 week+ for an appointment. Walked in and done in 20 minutes with no appointment. Originally said it shouldn't cost anything then they charged me $20 for a rotation (which they did) but I didn't expect to have it done for free anyways. Prices for other services were high (oil change $45) but if they're low on customers and you want it done fast this is the place to go. No appointment system available, just walk-ins.",Positive
Worst service from people who clearly don't care. Waiting 20 minutes for nobody to acknowledge my presence. Never going back again.,Negative
"This is the first and last time I will be giving this place my business. All I wanted was a simple oil change and what I got was horrible service from the beginning. What really upset and ruined this experience was the young woman at the desk. She didn't greet me, she just said take a seat we will come get you. Ok I'm fine with that, but when I notice they have my cars hood up and they are working on my car I walk up and ask, I mean attempt to ask if I needed to tell them what to put in my car as I wanted synthetic. After I got two words out she raised her voice and said we will come get you when we are ready like she was a teacher scolding a child. - Update - once I was called up she was much nicer so I bumped up to two stars. Unfortunately the damage has been done. In the future just let me know you will be running tests and checking fluids and that you will be with me afterwards.",Negative
"I bought a groupon for an oil change and tire rotation and called to get their hours for the next day. They had my car in and out in half an hour oil changed, windows washed, tires rotated, and floors vacuumed. I would definitely go back for my next oil change. The staff was friendly and though there must have been 8 other cars in the queue they were not doing a rush job on any of the vehicles there.",Positive
"Wow! This place is incredibly terrible. So, last week I went to Jiffy Lube for an oil change. I had a 50% off coupon from another Jiffy Lube (Cranberry). I asked ahead of time (Cranberry) to make sure they still accepted the coupon, he said that they change colors, but the codes are always the same, so they don't really expire. Great, right...Nope. I go to this Jiffy Lube (McKnight). First, they take my car and start the oil change (just the exterior stuff) before anyone talks to me. Then, they accuse me of making the coupon, or copying it, or something saying that they don't come in green. Then, he claims it is expired! (There is no expiration date ANYWHERE on the coupon, I checked before driving all the way there. So, after arguing with the guy, I decide I want my car back. He goes and gets the manager (all the while they are still doing stuff to my car). I tell the manager I want my car back. He goes back out and talks to the first guy again, and one of the mechanics comes in the office, grabs another 50% off coupon and says, ""just give her this."" Manager comes back and says, ""the best we can do is 25% off, that's a pretty good deal."" At this point I am thinking that they are probably going to use the 50% off coupon and pocket the difference, but who knows really? I again tell them I want my car back. He says something about them already starting. I say I don't care, I want my car back. After some additional arguing, they finally give me my car. Then the manager comes and stands at my window while I am calling my mom. So, I'm like, yes? He proceeds to tell be again that 25% is a good deal, and blocks my way forward out of the parking lot. At this point I did 2 things, 1. checked to make sure that my pepper spray was in the compartment in my door and 2. asked for his name. So, Alex, if you are out there, you are a jerk. You used your position to try to intimidate me into getting an oil change I didn't want, really, why? who does that? LADIES, for your own safety (just my opinion, but I didn't feel safe) do not go to this Jiffy Lube. P.S. Went to the Jiffy Lube in Sewickley today. Had no issues, got 50% off no questions asked. He also told me that the coupon codes are always the same on the coupons.",Negative
"I actually like this Jiffy Lube because there was no high pressure upselling on changing cabin air filters and what not. I had a coupon on my phone for 5 dollars off and the cashier actually gave me a book of coupons, pretty good deal.",Positive
They were extremely fast and very nice. I had a problem with my car that the mechanic (thanks Mikey) actually took a picture of to show me to explain the issue. He then helped me find a place to get it fixed and told me what to expect in price. Thanks guys for going above and beyond.,Positive
"I needed the oil changed on my car. Simple as that. The minute my husband drove it away, he knew they messed with something. It was fine when we took it in, and all of a sudden it wouldn't accelerate and it felt like the engine was going to shut off. We took it back multiple times and told them they clearly did something to the car, and they offered to diagnose it and then gave us the estimate to fix it. It was one of the spark plugs, and obviously I did NOT spend any more money there to have them fix what they broke. Shady, shady, shady. Avoid this place at all costs.",Negative
"Great service! Super fast! I was nervous at first, because one of the attendant's just pointed at another car in a bay. But, the manager came out and talked to me with a run-down of services for $43.95! That's a vacuum, oil-change, checks of all fluids with top-off, and other major checks, like battery, etc. Thanks, Jiffy Lube!",Positive
"I had a trip coming up. So I impulsively stopped by this location one day after getting off of work early. I parked and walked all around trying to find someone who worked there. I keep going in and out of the place, circling around back, etc. I began to wonder if they had gone out of business. I finally notice a man out back, smoking and talking on his phone. Looked like he could be a mechanic. But he didn't give me a nod or anything, so I went back to the waiting room. Eventually that same guy came in. I told him I'd like an oil change. He looked annoyed and told me how my car needs a more expensive oil. It was a new car to me, so I had some questions about that. He snapped at me about it being the way it is...and I just walked out at that point. Took my business elsewhere. Maybe the mechanics there are great, Idk. Either way, I'll never return.",Negative
"The service is ok but they tried to get me to replace a battery and other parts that were unnecessary. The battery in my car was completely fine. They try to get you to buy just about anything, I don't like that about jiffy lube. Do not go here",Negative
"I was in and out relatively quick, only an hour on a late Saturday morning. However, the customer service was horrendous. When I pulled my car up I was told an oil change would be $41. Then, after they had already gone through and inspected my car I was told it would be $65 for high mileage oil. I feel completely ripped off and will never be returning here. I should have been told upfront that the price varies based on the oil, especially since I drive an obviously older vehicle that is more likely to require the high mileage oil.",Negative
"Overall, good experience. I took in my Ford Explorer and they took care of me very well. Jesus, the guy who helped me was EXTREMELY friendly, and offered great customer service. He walked me through everything, and even asked me if I was a SEAHAWKS fan because of my shirt, even though he is a fan of the evil Arizona Cardinals. Talking sports with a customer might sound trivial to some, but that kind of customer service goes a long way. He even walked me to my car and opened the door for me. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because I think they may be a tad overpriced. Worth it though.",Positive
"We came here to get an oil change, but we couldn't even get in the door because the managar, Robert, was so extremely rude. He kept interrupting and talking over us. We kept telling him that all we wanted was an oil change, and he kept asking us over and over again to get extras that cost more. He walked away while we were talking to him, and when we told him we wanted to drop the car off he got angry with us, even though there was an hour and a half wait time. Then, when we were filling out the drop off paperwork, he kept (again) trying to get us to add more expensive options. I told him that I didn't want anything that would cost extra, and he replied ""Are we going to have a problem?"" I told him ""no, I just don't want anything that costs extra, that's what I keep telling you,"" and he said ""you don't have to give me any attitude."" Then he gave me my keys back and told us to leave. I tried to get my information back, including my address, phone number, name, and email (since I wasn't going to be a customer) and he refused to give me the paperwork. We had to actually rip the paperwork off the clipboard because he refused to return my information. I will NEVER go back to this location, because I don't trust the people there to give me the service I request, and I don't trust them with my personal information.",Negative
"My first oil change since arriving in Phoenix. Thank you for fast, friendly & efficient service. I liked having options & recommendations. Even though some of the recommended replacement product are pricey the value added service makes up for it.",Positive
Quick service. Everything else is very poor. Customer service poor. Adding on unnecessary charges not approved by me. Explanation of what I actual need and what they say I should get was fuzzy and couldn't get a straight answer really. No... I'll try and find another place I won't feel taken advantage of,Negative
"I was visiting from California when I noticed an oil leak. I took my car to this location and the guys there were awesome. Very honest and helpful. Checked my car, fixed my leak, and I was on my way.",Positive
"I've been wanting to get a Wrangler for some time now, finally stopped by and did it. Let me tell you I'm glad I picked this location. Nate was my first contact, very friendly and helpful. Things didn't quite go through the first time around no fault of theirs, it just wasn't in my budget. That's when Melinda got involved after a few messages back and forth she was able to get me into a Jeep that had the features I wanted, within the budget I needed to be at. And a color I love. She killed it! Thank you!",Positive
"UPDATE: yesterday 6/25/18 I leased a new 2019 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk firecracker red! Ended up trading my Camaro 2013 and my Jeep Renegade 2017 for this beauty! Thank you Charlene, Amy, Malinda, Jonhnny and Antonio, you guys went far and beyond to help me out! Mr. Marsh you have a great team! As long as these guys are there especially Charlene we will continue buying our cars from you! This was our 5th vehicle from Jim Marsh. We bought our third car from Jim Marsh On December 2017. We love it so much! Everyone at Jim Marsh took such good care of us. We bought a white 2017 Jeep Renegade and last week my parents bought a 2015 Jeep Renegade from Jim Marsh. That makes 4 cars from Jim Marsh!! We are very grateful for them taking good care of us everything we needed in a car. Thank you Melinda, Amy, Jonhnny and Antonio! I'm sure we'll back",Positive
"We had what we thought was a great sales experience snowball in to the worst experience in a car dealership ever. The sale was great on Monday and fast, but afterwards when we needed to know days later if the loan was approved we didn't hear from them so we had to contact them to get answers and at that time it hadn't. We told our salesman we would be in on Friday at 4:30 and he was supposed to be there to meet us. Of course we show up on Friday and he's not in so they called another guy to take care of us (Luis). He asked what we were there for and when we told him we hadn't heard from them and we figured the loan didn't get approved so we would be returning their car back and taking our trade back so we could make the pmt that was due on our truck he just said ok, asked no more questions and walked away. The whole time we thought he was helping us out, but everyone in the showroom was too busy watching the hockey game. Luis kept walking around and talking to others trying to score tickets to the game rather than checking in on us or updating us. My husband got up after 20 minutes of waiting blindly and asked what was taking so long and we had no answer. When they finally bring our truck around it had a flat on our brand new tires while they're sitting there trying to put air in it and telling me that it's holding air with a nail on the side wall . I lost it and finally spoke to mngr who apparently didn't know what was happening and went solely on the guy ""helping"" us opinion and attempted to cancel the deal no questions asked until I questioned the whole ordeal of being ignored with nothing answered for 30 min and a flat tire later. The manager realized he shouldn't have relied On someone who was not getting a commission out of our deal and who didn't care about anything other than the game. The manager finally stepped up and handled things and we had to keep our truck there one more day to get the tire replaced. In the end they lost a sale that turned out was approved that same day because at that point we went through with the cancellation. They did not deserve our business. They need to work on their work ethic and most of all on their customer service. One bad apple ruined it for all. I will not be shopping there again and instead went to Prestige down the street were I got a better deal and great customer service.",Negative
Brought my little Sister in to buy a new 2018 Jeep Renegade 4x4 from Daniel Freeman. She was very pleased and got a good financing plan from Chrysler Capital. We got top notch service from Daniel from start to finish. Don't go to the Chapman dealers they are looking to stab and grab and sell you a used car with tons of problems. Saved over 3500 from Chapman Jeeps deal on same Renegade model.,Positive
"To start off I have had a horrible week w several dealerships that treated us horribly by not listening to us and pushing what they want. Then we found Jim Marsh Jeep and boy they have made the experience so painless, fun and they made me feel amazing. Mark their GM and Troy my representative gave me all of the pros and cons and were trying to make sure it was a good fit for me. First time I've ever seen a dealership worry about me and not their bottom line. I will say after 15 years in Vegas Jim Marsh is the only place I will ever purchase a car again. I love them!!!",Positive
"I bought a brand new renegade from Jim Marsh When my first service was due I thought just bring it to them it will be easy, this is not the case do not bring your vehicle for service here. It says express lube on the website when I came in the service guy didn't know what I was talking about, it was 2 hrs to get a basic oil change, no appointment needed the website claims lol what a joke. The worst thing about it was after I said I would go somewhere else they didn't care. As long as I was buying something from them they were your best friend as soon as you walk out the door you don't exist. Stay classy Jim marsh",Negative
"Had a great purchase experience earlier this summer, but the vehicle has had a series of issues and service has been disappointing. Poor communication, bad customer service, and lack of knowledge on how to resolve the issues has caused me to lose faith in the vehicle and dealership. Update: Contacted Stephanie as per her invitation and shared my experience. She took notes on the details and said that I would be getting a call from the GM at the beginning of the week. It is now Friday and I have not been contacted by the GM. Further disappointment from this dealership.",Negative
"I decided to take my car (2015 Chrysler 200) to have its first oil change since I bought it used to a dealer, and Jim March was the closest one. I figured they would be able to tell me if anything looked out of whack on the undercarriage, or if there was something pressing that needed to be looked at. Chuck came out, took down my information, and got the car right in. They found a stripped drain plug bolt, replaced it, and had me out the door in under an hour, on a busy Saturday. Chuck was personable, and made me feel right at home, was interested in me, and not just my car, and provided me with not just superior service on my car, but an amazing customer service experience. 10 out of 10, I will be taking my car back for any service she might need. Amazing place.",Positive
"My husband and I went to Jim Marsh Jeep to check out the new Grand Cherokee. Salesman, Danny Drezner was AMAZING! He showed us the model we saw online and went over all the features included and other facts about the Grand Cherokee. The negotiation process was really straight forward and we ended up with a great deal on a brand new Grand Cherokee and a respectable price for our trade in. The finance manager, Amy King was the BEST!! She took the time to answer any questions and explained all the warranty packages available. The team at Jim Marsh did a fabulous job and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great deal. Thank you, I love my new Jeep!!!",Positive
"I was fortunate enough to work with Yousef and Antonio! Yousef provided great customer service and never made me feel pressured, especially being a female customer. He was very knowledgeable in describing the features of each vehicle and patient when it came to talking numbers. He was able to help me in getting the numbers I liked and I ended up with a brand new Grand Cherokee! I highly recommend this dealership!!",Positive
"My recent experience at Jim Marsh is a pitch perfect example of everything dealerships apparently don't yet understand about the inevitable shift towards online sales. Filled out credit application online through Chrysler, was pre-qualified, spoke to the internet sales manager, selected a car in advance, e-mailed back and forth throughout the day, scheduled a time to come in, and then drove 45 minutes across town to........start the entire process all over again with someone totally new who then gave completely different information and pricing. It's as if the whole internet side of that never actually happened, which is as frustrating as it is ridiculous in 2017.",Negative
"Yusef & Antonio are truly the go to guys if you're in need of a vehicle. The attention they show and willingness to help you get exactly what you want was a pleasant surprise for me and my wife. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted and treated like family. Also, Jeannie from finance was super AWESOME and explained all the details till we understood them all. HIGHLY RECOMMEND Jim Marsh for your next vehicle buying experience.",Positive
Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep is awesome. With the help of Antonio and Yusef we walk away with a better deal than we could ever imagine. Thank you for our new 2018 Jeep Cherokee,Positive
About as good of a car buying experience as you can get. We worked with Yousef and he was a nice guy. Very relaxed. It was a pretty low pressure environment. I would recommend them to anyone looking to buy a Jeep.,Positive
"My husband and I stopped by Jim Marsh just to look around. I loved the Jeep Grand Cherokees but I honestly thought they were way out of my league. We were greeted by the internet sales manager, who was actually on her way out for the day. She stopped to speak to us and answer any questions that we had, but we didn't have any. We just wanted to look around. She handed us off to Johnny with the cool socks who stayed close enough to be available if we had questions, but far enough away to not make us feel hovered over. Johnny had a call so he passed us off to Yousef who was, hands down, the nicest most helpful salesman that we could have ever hoped for. He was very knowledgeable about the truck and wasn't pushy or aggressive... Super nice guy. I felt bad because he was so attentive, but I felt like I was wasting his time because again, I was just looking around because I thought there was no way I'd get approved for a brand new Grand Cherokee. Guess what...I was WRONG! Youssef got me an AMAZING deal on the exact truck that I wanted! I could not have been happier with the service I received and my overall experience at Jim Marsh. I would highly recommend Jim Marsh to anyone looking for a new vehicle and if you do find yourself at Jim Marsh, ask for Yousef. You'll be very glad you did! We had a flawless experience and I now have the truck that I thought I could only dream about. THANK YOU YOUSEF & ANTONIO!",Positive
"My wife and I went to Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep to investigate a used truck for towing a lightweight travel trailer. We were greeted by Jon Picano who took the time to hear us out on what we were looking for. He advised and explained all the benefits that a Jeep Cherokee could give us and be powerful enough to tow our soon-to-be trailer. Craig Walters, a sales manager, stopped by to introduce himself. In short, these two gentlemen were professional, knowledgeable and great guys. I have never found a salesman so knowledgeable about his product like as Jon was about Jeeps. I had never considered one but we ended up with a low mileage Cherokee Trail Hawk. We are very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend Jon to anyone looking for a Chrysler or Jeep automobile. Special recognition must also go out to Luis who stepped up above and beyond the ""call of duty"" to help us get the vehicle ready for delivery when both Craig and Jon were off for the day. BUT, Jon was so involved and professional he came in for the delivery instruction on his day off. Look for another review of the pre-delivery detail department (or whatever it is called)..... pretty low stars for the detail guys. Well, it looks like the Yelp system won't permit me to write another review... Let's just say the detail department did the worst job I have ever seen (mine or anyone else's) in my 52 years of driving/buying cars. Our Jeep was a used Cherokee TrailHawk that was 3.2 years old. When we were to pick up the Jeep the remnants of dog hair and dirty windows inside, dead bug guts between the Jeep's seven pillars trademark front end grill along with dirty particulate on the top of bumpers (which Jon cleaned off upon my inspection). There was sandy particulate in the front seat cup holders keeping the strands of dog hair company! The new tires looked good, the recalls were either verified done or done during prep. The Cherokee was/is in good mechanical condition thanks to that team but the detail folks were slow and not up to the standards it should have been. I would buy from Jon, Luis, Craig and Amy (finance) again.... However, I would send donuts to the detail crew so they get their tough job done right!",Positive
"I was looking to lease a jeep wrangle for my daughter, and I called a few jeep dealerships in town and got the run around or no return call. At Jim Marsh a gentlemen by the name of Craig Waters took my call and gave me the information I needed to see if leasing a jeep would be in my budget. Of course the information he could give was a ball park figure because I had a trade and they hadn't seen my credit information. I decided to take my trade and go to see them. I met Craig and Antonio when I got there. These two guys did such a great job with my jeep wrangle lease that I called my wife and had her come by and we leased a Jeep Grand Cherokee also. This is a great place to purchase or lease a vehicle. Thank you so much and God bless.",Positive
"I would just like to say this is one of the most honest car dealership out there, I had the best Salesman named Johnny. He helped me and my husband find the car that was right for us. They also worked with us on an amazing deal.",Positive
"Yousef and Luis were absolutely fantastic! They took the time to get to know me and we went step by step on everything they did not skip over any of the details. I'm the kind of guy to do the paperwork first and get the numbers then go for a test drive. Yousef is an amazing salesmen, I walked in and wanted to get into something that I was able to take on a few trails out here or when it's winter go up to Mt. Charleston without any issue. We took a look at a few cars and he was able to find something that was around my budget for the payment. Luis was the sales manager and he did everything for me. They gave me more money for my trade than any of the other dealerships. Yousef and Luis treated me with the up most respect and were not demanding at all. Both of them have phenomenal customer service and really care about the person they're helping. After leaving the dealership I did not feel like they rushed me into buying the car (unlike most dealerships). I was extremely happy with my purchase!",Positive
"Jim Marsh is in all respects the best Jeep dealership in Las Vegas. I know because in the weeks before I bought my Jeep from Jim Marsh I shopped them all. I found Jim Marsh through the True Car app and my first contact with the dealership was a phone call from Melinda Quackenbush. She gave me a direct answer to every question I asked. When I asked her for out the door numbers she gave them to me without any hassle, and also gave me an estimated range of what Jim Marsh would give me for my trade. Every other dealership hassled me about getting out the door numbers on the vehicles they were trying to sell me, and flat out refused to talk numbers on my trade without seeing it. When I arrived at the dealership, the sales person I met with was Johnny Manglona. He was professional, courteous, and treated me like an intelligent human being. I have bought about a dozen cars in my lifetime, and every other dealership I have dealt with told me at least 2 lies: First, that they were losing money on the deal they were offering me. Second, that the invoice reflects the amount the dealer actually pays for the vehicle. Johnny is the first car salesman to ever earn not only my business, but my trust by not telling me either of those lies. There are several other major differences between Jim Marsh and other dealerships that I appreciate. For example, the numbers they presented to me in the showroom matched what Melinda told me on the phone. Additionally, they didn't try to sell me thousands of dollars worth of mandatory ""dealer add ons"" like the Towbin and Prestige dealerships do. And probably most importantly, after the test drive when we got to the stage where Johnny came out of the sales manager's office with a written offer for the vehicle I had chosen, THE NUMBERS WERE ACTUALLY REASONABLE ... THE FIRST TIME! I even told Johnny right there on the spot that I appreciated them presenting me with reasonable numbers the first time around. Being a veteran car buyer and an attorney I drive a pretty hard bargain, and I usually have to tell dealers to get lost 3 or 4 times before getting to a reasonable deal. I didn't have to do any of that with Jim Marsh. I did negotiate with them a bit, but the tenor of the negotiations was completely different than any other car deal I have ever worked - there was clear mutual respect that is unfortunately lacking in most other car dealership transactions. Once we agreed on the terms of our deal, I met with the general manager Mark Grim. I didn't want to let the dealership run my credit because I had my own financing in place and didn't want another hit to my credit score. He explained that there was an additional $1000 incentive available if I had a certain credit score, even if I didn't finance through them. I was skeptical so I told him that I would let him run my credit if he put that promise in writing. Once again he surprised me by agreeing to put it in writing without any hassle. He got a piece of paper, wrote it down, and signed it. Then, when he contacted the lender for the balance owed on my trade, he found out it was actually about $700 less than I thought I was. I believe most dealerships never would have told me that, and would have added that $700 to their profit on the deal, but he came right out, told me, and took that $700 off the out the door number I had already agreed to pay. Finally, I met with Amy King in the finance office. She had some pretty good warranty products to offer, and tried hard to sell them to me. But I never keep cars long enough to use the warranty so I stopped buying warranties about 5 cars ago. If I thought I might still have this Jeep in 5 years I definitely would have bought the warranty she was offering, but I plan on going back to Jim Marsh for another Jeep in a couple of years so I declined. Just like everyone I dealt with at Jim Marsh, she treated me with respect, even when I said I wasn't going to buy the warranty. Overall Jim Marsh was not only the most transparent and respectful in their dealings with me, they also gave me the best deal of any dealership I dealt with. I walked away with a vehicle that was 2 trim levels above what I had considered at other dealerships, and I paid $2000 less than the best offer I got from anyone else.",Positive
"Recently purchased a 2017 Jeep Cherokee from Jim Marsh. Thank you to Yousef and Antonio for making the car buying experience pleasant. Yousef explained the feautures and demoed the car seamlessly. Antonio was timely in following up with price negotiations. Also, thank you to Melinda for your continued text follow ups to assist in finding the vehicle I was ultimately looking for, and lastly Jeannie in the finance department for being pleasant and accommodating.",Positive
"After leaving a dealership down the road because we couldn't come to terms, we happened to walk in here and met Nate Sugarman. (Not sure if that's his stage name or not!) The customer service was simply amazing. He was wonderful from the test drive to the paperwork signing; even staying late to make sure everything was handled properly. If you ever need a vehicle, please stop by and see Nate!",Positive
"Very Poor Customer Service, For a newer dealer you would think they would be more customer service friendly. We were refereed to come to this service center for our car and the first impression was great. The second time here the older gentlemen Chuck, was very unprofessional and rude and trying to talk to the service manager, that was a joke, he pushes people away when he does not get his way. And be aware if you involve corporate, they will ban you from there dealership. We have tried peacefully to talk to them and they just do not care!",Negative
"Introduction: If you know us, we always buy cars in pairs. Meaning two back to back. Last week, we got the Infiniti Q30 and tonight we got the Cherokee Altitude from this AMAZING dealership ""Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep"". Customer Service: 5/5 I must say that I am ecstatic of how OUTSTANDING everyone is at this dealership. From the moment you walked in, to the last minute you walk out. I had the pleasure to deal with Melinda, who actually brought me to this dealership in the first place. Why? Talking about World Class service. I just have one word to describe Melinda, ""WOW"". Yes, the way she did her due diligence in handling customer experience, I've never seen anyone so professional like Melinda. Especially, when there's three other Jeep dealerships way closer to us. We chose to come here, tells you how powerful her service was. Let's not forget Troy, our super Sales Consultant. The minute we walked in, we were acknowledged loud and proud. Helping us with open arms. In addition, the Sales manager also came by to drop us two bottles of water and say hello. Clearly, this dealership has it right when it comes to providing exceptional customer satisfaction. Last but not least, our finance expert Jeannie was also super pleasant to deal with. Pleasant experience all around, never thought I would say this about a car dealership, but here it is ""I Love this Place"". Price: 5/5 OMG! BEST DEAL in town, actually, in this Universe, man did they give us a deal. They saved us so much money that my jaw dropped. At ""Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep"" everyone makes you feel so comfortable. They are here to make the deal work by compromising and reason with you. You have to be reasonable and meet them half way of course. Be fair in other words. Atmosphere: 5/5 Cozy, another word you don't expect to hear or describe at a dealership. However, visit here and you'll see exactly what I mean. It's a brand new facility that was just opened since February of 2017, that's barely two months. Yes, like I said, it's GORGEOUS & COZY! Cleanliness: 5/5 Clearly, it's immaculate!!! Tips: There's actually another Jeep dealership literally couple minutes away from this one. You want to make sure you look at the address and come to ""Jim Marsh Chrysler Jeep"" if you want this amazing experience I got.",Positive
"Awesome people here, I highly recommend buying from these guys. I went in not knowing what to expect, and left with a new car and new friends. I made an appointment with Jon over the phone, but he was busy when I got there. No problem he had James help me out, and with James and Jon they made me feel like family and made the car buying process an easy experience with no hassle. It took me a few cars to find the perfect one, but Luis and Antonio helped with that and found me the perfect Jeep. The finance process was smooth and quick, can't wait till I'm ready to buy again, so I can come in and purchase another Jeep from these guys.",Positive
"Our experience here was great. Our sales people were Nate and Luis, they answered all our questions and worked really hard. We were also helped by Amy and Antonio. Being that it is a new dealership and please consider this as you read on - the internet went down for a little bit, some of our questions that got answered were incorrect, when getting our green slip we had to go back twice because of miscommunication. I did speak to a gentleman when I finally got my greenslip and he did a good job at calming me down because I was very frustrated. I am sorry that I didn't get his name. But becasue he took the time to assist me I will still give Jim Marsh Jeep 5 stars. The next time I go back I will look for him so that I can tell you his name.",Positive
"Stopped in on 2-25-17 with our daughter as she was looking for a new Jeep Willy to purchase. We talked with Nate Sugarman. What a great guy! No high pressure sales just answered our questions honestly. My husband and I own a Rubicon and so do my parents so this is a third generation owner of a jeep. Nate was super helpful and very kind. The sales manager Mark Grim was also fantastic! Our daughter ended up purchasing the jeep and took it home the same day! We have visited many dealerships around the Las Vegas area and have never had such a pleasant, no hassle experience! Our daughter also met with Amy King, the finance manager and couldn't say enough great things about her! She even took a picture of our daughter driving away in her new jeep and sent it to her! We were lucky enough to even meet Jim Marsh that day. If you are in the market for a vehicle, make sure you stop in. You will not be disappointed. We left there feeling like they were family. We will be purchasing all of our future vehicles and having our current ones serviced at Jim Marsh Jeep! Thank you for making our daughters dream come true!!!",Positive
"I took my car here a few weeks ago to be repaired it's a brand new vehicle and a new redesigned model unfortunately I was rear-ended and was very nervous about where to take my vehicle. After speaking with my dealer I decided on taking my car to Jim Marsh Auto Body on Centennial.. Jonathan was the representative that assisted me through the entire process and I can't say enough good things about him or Jim Marsh!!! He was amazing and very kind and gentle and informative and understanding of my fear that my car would never be the same. He kept me informed every step of the way by phone call or email, I never had to wonder what was going on while my car was being repaired.. The reception staff was equally as professional kind and concerned about giving great service to every customer that walk through the door I was always greeted immediately and never waited longer than 5 minutes to see anyone. And if I had needed to wait I wouldn't have minded when you're dealing with something that so important patience is always the key. My car was repaired earlier than was expected everything was thoroughly explain to me I was provided all the propriate paperwork, and most importantly the car really does look brand new!!! So very pleased on the work that they did and would recommend anyone take their car to Jim Marsh!!! Thank you guys for your great service and the great work you did on my vehicle!",Positive
"Attention all Jeep owners. I have been to every Jeep dealership in the entire valley (except the one in Henderson, only because it was too far). I was ripped off, abused and taken advantage of in all cases!! My jeep is under warranty but it got so bad I was taking it to little independent shops for everything I needed. I had used Jim Marsh body shop once and thought how professional they were so when I heard they opened a Jeep franchise, I thought, what could I loose? Let me tell all you Jeep/Chrysler owners, Jim Marsh has done it again! This place treats you like gold, like a customer, like your valued! None of these items did I get from all the other Jeep places in Las Vegas. And the great part, they DON""T rip you or Jeep Corp off! They are HONEST. I Know Right! Go Figure. Seriously, If you own a Jeep/Chrysler product and don't check this new dealership at Jim Marsh, you are doing yourself a disservice. There is actually room to park!",Positive
I thought I would give Jim Marsh's new Jeep store a try because I have been unhappy with my previous dealers. Roy took my vehicle in and went over everything I needed. I hadn't been real good about my maintenance and explained all that was needed to bring it back to top condition. I thought the prices were fair for all the work I needed. Highly recommend.,Positive
"Great customer service. We had an estimate within a few minutes of getting there. Brought it in for service and it was done sooner than expected. Thought it only needed freon, but a fan also needed to be replaced. Went home in totally cold air. Will return when needed",Positive
Went here to get some repairs done. They are extremely honest and efficient. They treat you like family. Cost is very reasonable. I would recommend this place to everyone i know!,Positive
Great service! Honest and fair. No wonder they have been in business for so long! I have been dealing with a lot of different people and garages lately. These guys have been honest and have done things super quickly and reasonably. They don't overprice you and they don't charge you for something you don't need.,Positive
"My family has been coming to this garage for over twenty years which should tell you the level of trust we have in the owners and workers here. Just brought in my wife's 2006 sonata and had repairs recommended by a dealership done by them for half of what the dealership wanted. We now live in Surprise so it can be quite a haul to bring in a vehicle here but I wouldn't want to take my vehicles anywhere else. I trust them, enough said.",Positive
"I have real mixed feelings on writing this review. I only brought my truck here because I was told it was an honest reputable shop. Eventually they fixed the blower, after 3 trips and 3 days without my truck, I was very fortunate I had alternative transportation, or I would of been extremely angry. They used a cheep aftermarket blower that was noisy ! I had to pick it up after hours or I would of refused to take it. Brought the truck back, they replaced it with another cheep noisy blower,left it there this time, and on the 3 rd try, they finally put a GM blower in, and all was well with my world. I would think twice about coming back here again, even tho they apologized up one side and down the other.",Negative
I had a great experience today. Brought my car in around noon for a brake inspection and they had me on the road within a couple hours. This is surprising because usually on a Saturday most places are busy and they seemed very glad to help me get done in the same day. The guy at the counter was very helpful as he recommended a coupon online which saved me some money which is always a nice perk. The oil change is cheaper than I was paying for it at my other place so at least from now on I'll bring it here to get my work done. Thank you for a pleasant experience!,Positive
"I have been coming here for years and today they tried to bend me over!! I brought my car in a few months back for an oil change, at the time we asked for our brakes to be checked out too. When we come to pick the car up the guy said nothing about the brakes so my husband asked and he said they were fine but we got the impression he forgot to check, by his response. Anyhow he stated that the oil was black because we apparently waited longer than we should so we should come back again after 1k miles or so. Soooo here we are today. I brought the car in and asked for my oil change and again asked them to check the brakes. I received a call half an hour later saying oil change and brakes would cost me $691!! Haha nooo!! I told him forget it and I would be picking up my car. I called AutoZone and ordered my brakes for $40. I then received another call from Kerry's saying he miscalculated and t would only cost me $520...that's a $170 miscalculation...are you kidding me? Then I said, ""no thanks, I ordered them for $40 and will be doing my brakes myself. Just finish the oil change."" Income to pick it up for the oil change which ran me just shy of $60 and the guys says, "" I printed a coupon for you because had I not you would have been shocked."" Seriously??? I told him thanks but then made sure he knew that after so many years of loyalty to them that I will never be coming back.",Negative
"Alex, Gary and Annmarie are always there for my car repair needs, always very professional and they ALWAYS do the job right the first time. 6 stars!",Positive
"I made an appointment for today at 3pm. I showed up 10 mins early and the white old man acted like I didn't have an appointment. Also treated me like I needed to be squeezed in. He was rude and asked me every single question I already answered the day before. I told the guy on the phone I had a coupon for 19.99 oil change. In no part of the conversation did he say mine would be 48 dollars. The guy I dealt with today was beyond rude, and I walked out. Don't ever go here I know I won't.",Negative
"I took my car in on April 28th for an oil change and to fix my driver's side headlight. I am always wary of new auto repair shops, because let's face it, a lot of them are crooked. NOT so with Kerry's Car Care. They are very honest and will not add unnecessary charges to your bill. A huge shoutout to Otto...this guy is the epitome of customer service. And he is very personable, too. I will recommend this place to anny and everyone. Trust!",Positive
Took my car in for the oil change. Wanted them to look at my air conditioner quoted me a price of over 2000. Expensive and upsell. Had the work done elsewhere for 1300. I learned along time ago beware of a place that has a service writer they have to get paid too.,Negative
"I called to ask for a quote to have a starter replaced. The gentleman who answered the phone refused. I told him I already had AAA test the battery and determine it was the starter. They are still welcome to run their tests, and I understand it's only an estimate but the gentleman still said it could be many different things and refused any type of quote. He talked to me very condescending. I called 4 other places and every single place gave me a price or a price range. I feel they would want to jack up the price on me. This is actually the second time they refused to give a quote over the phone. I was willing to give a second chance. When the sale ad came in the mail today I did not hesitate to throw it away.",Negative
Went in on a advertisement for a oil change because they are local for me and $110.00 later with $700.00 in so called repairs I left without having done because my car didn't need them. Can't afford the prices. They were nice but I just wanted the 29.99 special.,Negative
"Took my car in today for an issue with my breaks. Had a family member replace my brakes for me, and afterward the car just wouldn't stop properly. Talked to the mechanic and told him what was going on, he took it for a test drive and said it Definitely needed to be checked out. I was in and out in less than an hour and it didn't cost much At All! Now my car stops when it's supposed to! Wonderful service and a decent price!",Positive
"DO NOT USE THESE GUYS. They will probably just cheat you out of your money. I took my old Honda in for an oil change a couple days ago and asked them to take a look at the A/C because it doesn't blow out cold air sometimes. They come back to me and let me know that there is some leakage, but that they can refill with freon for a total bill of about $180. I pay and drive off thinking that the Honda should have a temporary fix for now. WRONG. The next afternoon the A/C is blowing WITHOUT cold air in the AZ summer heat. So I take it in the next morning for them to look at it again. They call me telling me the WHOLE system needs replacing for a whopping $2,000. I try to talk to them about the fact that they sold me a cheaper service that didn't fix the problem I brought it in for, trying to reach some sort of middle ground, but of course they don't want to help me out. That's the worst kind of business I've ever experienced! I'm a 20 year old woman, and my boyfriend and I have just this little Honda to help us get around. But at least they made a quick buck off the fact that I don't know any better, right?",Negative
"They got me in quick on my way to work to get my tire fixed. They were fast, efficient, and reasonable. The waiting room is nice and I was able to work with Wi-Fi in the waiting room.",Positive
"Very overpriced .Went there for oil change and front tires balance .Just for the balance$39.99 ???No free estimate??? If anyway decade to go there make sure you negotiate every repair or service . I use to go there since 2005,but no longer . They lost my business forever. And the last: If Gerry is there,just run away to some other shop!",Negative
"Beware of these guys. I gave Kerry's a negative review because of an $1800.00 estimate they gave me for a clutch repair for which I was able to go elsewhere and have it done for under $800.00. I then received a call days later from a gentleman at Kerry's that wanted to discuss my review. During our civil conversation the gentleman became frustrated to the point where he stated the he wants to ""RUIN ME"". What he does not know is that I recorded the conversation. Moral of the story. If you give Kerry's a negative review, they will use hardline tactics and even threats if they can't persuade you to see things their way. Customers Beware !!!!",Negative
"I decided to try and stay local and have my oil changed here but these guys must think we are all stupid. 1 oil change for 90 bucks!!! OMG talk about rape!!! Went to Arrowhead Honda for the same thing and walked out paying 35 bucks, tires rotated for free and a free car wash. I will never go to Kerry's Rape repair shop and will go out of my way to tell people to do the same.",Negative
"I had to replace everything under my timing cover. (Timing belt kit, water pump, tensioner, etc) Had three different shops, including the dealer, tell me this. Kerry ended up doing a price match, saving me some cash. Took the car in and had it back before they closed, on a busy day! Remarkable considering the amount of labor it takes to get to the timing belt. I was very pleased with the honesty and overall customer service. All the gentleman were more than willing to help. They also photograph everything that they find wrong, which is great to ensure you're not getting hustled. Plus, for an auto shop, it is very classy and clean inside. Definitely, going to be returning for all my auto maintenance. (67th ave location)",Positive
Rip off. The first time I came here my oil change was $40 or $50 which I would expect. I brought the same car back in 3 months later for another oil change. They told me it would be $100. Do not come here. Find another place. They will try to screw women over. What a shame.,Negative
"Took my car in for an overheating issue. First visit cost me $550 dollars and was told the issue was fixed. Four days later the exact same issue began happening again. Took it back to them and was told that they found the problem for sure this time. When my wife asked if they were positive they found the problem, she was told ""We're not in the business of making you have to come back. The mechanic is sure this is the problem."" Another $400. Low and behold today it began doing the exact same thing. There's no way I will be taking it back for a third visit. To be told two separate times that the issue is absolutely resolved when it clearly wasn't is enough to lose our business for good. If you want your car fixed properly, stay away from here and go to a reputable shop who follows the fair pricing guidelines, AND will actually fix your car properly the first time. Now I'm out almost $1000 dollars and still have a broken car.",Negative
"I had the same type of horrible experience Melissa S. encountered last year. This must be standard operating procedure when they see a foreign vehicle. Let's tell 'em about 7 grand, this freight from Germany is expensive. What is Kerry himself going to jump in a boat and row over their and get the part? I was quoted around $7500 for my estimate. I ended up taking the vehicle to the Mercedes dealership and had the problem fixed for $947. Usually dealerships are more expensive, but not in this case. There are only two possible scenarios: Kerry's employees completely incompetent mechanics or completely corrupt mechanics. Avoid this place at all costs!",Negative
"I had a water pump work done on my 2003 Camery and I have to say these guys are honest. The guy I talk to was Gary and he was professional and courteous. I told him I had a time constraint and he assured me it wouldn't be a problem. I had my car ready in about two hours and he called me and asked if I needed a shuttle to the shop which I didn't need but was appreciated. I will definitely come back to Kerry's. Also, he honored my coupon without presenting it on paper but by smart phone.",Positive
"Brought my Dodge Dakota in to have the AC checked out - clutch was cycling on and off and knew it meant low freon. They were busy, but squeezed me in within an hour and quickly diagnosed the problem (leaky service valves) and repaired the problems. Only needed one valve but they recommended we replace the second and I agreed - they replaced both and only charged me for one. Repair was done well and at a fair price. Recommend them!",Positive
"We've had our car worked on here before with no issues. Brought them a friend's Mercedes, which needed a diagnostic and turned out to need a new alternator. We are fully aware that Mercedes parts and service are more expensive than American cars. However, Kerry's told us this part was a special order from Germany only, and with part, shipping and labor, the total cost would be $7700. Yes, SEVEN THOUSAND. We took the car home wondering what to do, since this used car as a whole cost not much more than the cost of this potential repair. I made a phone call to another German auto specialist who laughed at that price and said, after confirming the same special part (which they had in stock) would cost $2000, out the door, including labor and tax. I can see two different places having different prices, but a difference of $5500??? Clearly, Kerry's either doesn't know what they're doing, or they intentionally try to rip off people whom they know are unfamiliar with cars. I would never recommend this place to anyone after this.",Negative
"Very overpriced. Went in to get my car looked at, charged me $112, and than couldn't tell me what the problem was. Gave me multiple things off what it could be. Ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars to fix. Got a diagnostic and quote from another auto shop and way less cheaper and they were able to find my problem without charging me for a diagnostic check. Will never go to Kerry's again.",Negative
"SORRY I HAVE TO PUT A STAR AT ALL !!! I highly recommend to NOT USE Kerry's Car Care! They work on your car and then you need more stuff done and you have to pay more money to get your auto running right. Took my mother's van there for a routine front end alignment and oil change, should have cost about $100.00. Well $343.00 later the alignment and oil change weredone only for us to get her van back and after driving it home, it wouldn't even start. Took it back and of course this time she had to spend $1200.00 to get it fixed so it would ""run like new"". Well that didn't happen! We took it back 5 times and supposingly they did more work to it and ""didn't charge us for parts or labor"". And it still didn't run right. Each time we took it back they found something wrong and each time we got it back it still ran very poorly! The last time they found SOMETHING ELSE wrong with it and wanted to charge us! At this point NO WAY WERE WE GOING TO LET THEM ""FIX SOMETHING"" ELSE! Her van ran great prior to taking it to Kerry's!",Negative
You cant win all .I been going for a few yrs about 6 amd they save me lots of being a woman when comes to auto shops Kerry works for me..,Positive
"Mediocre service, and very hostile if you ask too many prodding questions or contradict them in any way. WAY overpriced, both for parts and labor, especially considering the service is shoddy- They even managed to mess up a fluid change because my Manual Trans uses ATF type F, so it seemed they didnt add any fluid at all (is type F too expensive for them? it shouldnt be with their labor rates!), and they didnt follow the directions on the lid for the power steering reservoir (which also specified ATF type F but they filled with generic power-steering fluid).",Negative
They wouldnt even post my review that I left on their website. Wow. Really makes me want to go back. Beware- reviews on their website are filtered and half are probably made up as well.,Negative
"This place is way over priced, to me, they replaced my alternator I dont think it was even my alernator my battery was dead and they said I need to replace it but they still said it was my aternator, total out the door $604.00 PEPP BOYS for the same service $480.00 wont be going here again ever..",Negative
"An oil change & check-up coupon got me in here, but I won't be back. They quoted me for legitimate repairs, but a second opinion down the road at Champ's saved me $250 (nearly 50%). Prices for parts (both after-market and OEM) were high as well as labor. Check around of course before you commit to anything...but be wary of Kerry's.",Negative
"So I have been taking my car to Kerry's for over 2 years. They have treated me pretty good, so I keep going back. Today however, is a different story. I took my car to them for an oil change and tire rotation. I used the annual checkup coupon that offers oil change, tire rotation, battery check, fluid check, yada yada yada... for $20. I chocked my tires to make sure the tires were rotated, because the last time I took my car to them they supposedly rotated my tires, when in-fact they did not. I did an upgrade on the oil its like MAO oil I think, and just paid the difference. My check engine light was on when I brought the car to them, they never even told me the light was on, let alone what the problem was. When I got home, I remembered to check the tires, and sure enough, they didn't rotate them. This worries me. If they cannot rotate the tires when you ask them to, what else do they conveniently forget to do? Add oil to your car? Or, what if they don't even bother to do the oil change? How do you know? One thing I could all way's count on when I bring my car to them:HONESTY. About six months ago I learned of a small leak in the power steering line, Kerry's never bothered to let me know the leak was any worse then it was six months ago. It is all most as if they just rushed me out of there, completing half the work. This is the first bad experience with them. I will go back for oil changes, but I'm going to watch them. this I hate to do, but my trust in them has wavered.",Negative
"I use to take my car here. It is extremely over-priced, and they constantly try to use the scare tactic. Being a female they thought they could do that. Now I take my car elsewhere, not spending money there anymore.",Negative
"Excellent customer service, the job was better and much faster than expected. They are under a new manager and are dedicated to quality.",Positive
"I was skeptical based on the reviews that I read on Yelp, but have heard great things about Line-X so I went in anyway to talk to them. It appears that the prior management has moved on and Will is running the show now. Worked with Will and got a great bedliner that I am thrilled with, service was top notch. 3 hours in and out and a beautiful job. Thanks Will!",Positive
"Took my brand new 2017 f-250 in to have spray in bed liner. Got it back with the entire hood, roof, windshield, tops of mirrors, rims, bed etc covered with overspray. They told me to take it to the car wash to have it detailed and I did but they couldn't get all the scratches out because some of them were too deep. I brought it back to them to show them and he blamed it on the car wash. They completely washed their hands from the whole thing. Kinda sucks that someone runs a business and doesn't care enough to protect someone's truck and stand behind their mistake",Negative
"The two stars is because I like Line-X. The lack of more stars is because I didn't have the best experience at the Gilbert shop. I had called in my appointment a few days in advance and let them know that I wanted black with UV. When I got there, they had me down for black with no UV. Easy fix. Then I told them I did not want the sticker on my window. When I came back the next day to pick up my truck, there was a sticker. I checked the quality of the work, and noticed a piece of liner that had not been cut off. They told me they'd take care of it, and it'd be done while I went to get my wife at the airport. When I returned to get my truck, it had not been addressed. Final, and largest gripe, is that my wife is in the Air Force and we called around to see who offered a military discount. She was told they offered 10% off when she called, so we chose them. Upon payment I was told that wasn't accurate and that nobody there would have said that. I even told them the guy's name that told my wife that, who they acknowledged worked there, but I was still dismissed and told that it was $25. In the end all I needed to be happy was for them not to put a sticker on my truck, spend 1 minute fixing an installation issue, and honor the military discount quote (a difference of about $20 I think). These little things all added up to a poor experience which is causing their poor Yelp rating to remain poor. Worst thing is that this all happened dealing with the owner directly. Avoid this place and try somewhere else. I know I will if I ever need Line-X on another truck.",Negative
"Worst line-x job done,Pete somehow manage to get overspray all over my truck claimed to completely covered my truck but somehow manage to have overspray all over the cab and glass of my 2016 Ram truck, tried to work with them to get it resolved but was told it wasn't there problem.Pete denied there was anything wrong but I took it several places to confirm it was overspray all over the paint and glass.Will be taking them to court. Very dissatisfied customer!!!!!! Do not go to line-x in Gilbert Az,poor workmanship and customer service will deny everything about what you say it's not there product.",Negative
"Line-X advertises that you will have a lifetime warranty with purchase, only if if you have the warranty card. Even if you have the receipt from the original it will not help. And whatever you do, do not, DO NOT go to the Gilbert Shop you will be very sorry that you did. I rated one star because i did not see how to rate them any lower.",Negative
"I too, had the same experience. It is going on two weeks and no call from the repair person. He repaired this couch several years ago and we were very happy. If I don't get a call this week, I will seek a service elsewhere. Apparently, he is not interested in my repair. The partnership with Creative Leather is not good for his business.",Negative
"I was referred to Leather Like New by Creative Leather in Scottsdale where we purchased our couch. We waited over 6 weeks to finally be able to get an appointment. On the day of the appointment, I got a call from Fred, 10 minutes after the appointment time saying he would not be there. He promised to make my appointment a priority the next day even though he said he was too busy. He did not call the next day and then did not call me until the next Monday when he told me that I would be in the top 20 of his 120 appointments. Since then he has tried to contact me but I contacted the Creative Leather contact to tell her that I was not comfortable moving forward. Apparently that message never got to Fred. Apparently they are all too busy to communicate among themselves and more importantly to customers.",Negative
I initially called to inquire about their services and to receive a quote about some discoloration on my leather couch. Spoke to Becky and said they could fix it. She mentioned Fred would contact me. It's going on 2 weeks... Bad business. I would have given them a try but I think Ill take my business elsewhere.,Negative
"OMG...my furniture looks amazing. I was ready to put on front lawn with a sign that said ""free"" and this company saved it. I have told numerous people about this company and what they do and everyone is so thrilled to find out about them. I am highly recommending them and their customer service is superb. Thank you so much!!!!",Positive
"Fred came to my home to see what could be done, if anything to revitalize and repair my 14 year old sofa and overstuffed chair. They had really stated to look like trash. The seats were worn out and the springs in the frame were coming undone. I had seen some of Fred's completed work on furniture he had fixed, but never knew what the pieces looked like before hand. My set cost about $6,000.00 years ago so not the super expensive leather, but still not cheap. Besides I really love the set and wanted to see if it could be saved. Here are some before and after pictures For a couple of thousand dollars, they are as good if not better than new. They did an amazing job!! Thank you so much. Worth every cent I'm amazed:) Trying to post the after photo, but having a problem doing it. I'll get it figured out.",Positive
"They delivered, responded quickly, went above and beyond, excellent workmanship, and everyone was professional and friendly. Had four couches done and it exceeded my expectations for price and quality of work. Would highly recommend.",Positive
"My experience with Leather Like New was excellent. All six of the chairs (four kitchen, and two living room) I had reupholstered are beautiful. I am thrilled with the quality professionalism of this business. They made many trips out to my house to give me quotes, and pick up chairs, and deliver. The work was done faster than expected. They lived up to, and surpassed my expectations. Fred is a pleasure to work with. Highly recommended!",Positive
"Our tan leather furniture was badly stained with cat urine. I called several leather restoration companies but none were able to offer any real solutions to the problem. We were sure we would have to replace the furniture, but decided to contact Leather Like New. Fred came to our house and recommended completely replacing the stained leather panel and underlying padding. Since our furniture was quite faded, we also spoke to him about re-dyeing all three pieces. Fred quoted a very reasonable price to replace the damaged leather and re-dye our couch, armchair and ottoman. This was two weeks ago and the refurbished furniture was delivered today. I honestly thought they had delivered somebody else's furniture by mistake. It is gorgeous. The leather looks better now than it did when new, as Fred and the team used a deeper, richer tan shade that perfectly complements the rug and other furniture in the room. The new leather panel and stitching blends completely. I highly recommend Leather Like New. This company is staffed by experienced professionals who truly know their craft. We will enjoy our ""new"" furniture for many years to come.",Positive
"Completely erased some puppy scratches on both arms, they look brand new! Chris was great, did a good job and will definitely use them again.",Positive
"Can hardly believe my eyes. Our damaged leather chair, covered with nasty cat scratches, is virtually like BRAND NEW. This Fred is some kind of miracle worker with leather. Highest possible rating: a very good business!!!!!!",Positive
"Our 15 year old leather sofa incl. 2 matching chairs were showing their age. Fred and his team recommended that it needs refurbishing. The work was done in a very short time which fitted our schedule in the summer of 2014. As it turned out we had some minor defects, partly due to age, I called one day before Christmas 2014, Fred responded immediately and promised to come before New Years Day. Again he came timely and the work was finished January 2, 2015 at no charge. Tony the technician who did most of the work at our home was extremely polite, careful and a pleasure to work with. We can highly recommend this company.",Positive
"it was not a good experience,they came over to my house and told me about how good his work is and the big changes i am going to see in my sofas cushiones since he is going to replace them and they are not going to be soft like they are,and he supposed to replace 2 of my cushions leather with a whole new one . i paid him half of what he asked for and 2 weeks later they brought my cushions back. here is the shock he did not replace my inside filling and he only replaced one of my leather covers . everything else was only staining them and that was it . i called him and after talking to him he said he will only chang the filling inside three of my cushions( i have 6 of them).they did that and after i paid him i told him about the other leather that they did not replace and they never call me back or answer my phone calls. they are all about money,the minute they get their money from you forget about it .you will not get them to stand behind their work at all. it is been the worst experience ever . please be aware and don't hire them to do your leather.",Negative
"Wow! I just can't tell you how impressed we are with everyone at Leather Like New. I brought in four VERY used bar stools to see if they could bring the seat leather back to life. They went over the stools in detail, asking many questions and really took the time to understand the final look that we desired. I was a bit apprehensive but within a few short days, we got a call that they where ready for pick-up. The stools look absolutely amazing! I'm a total perfectionist and still can't believe how good they look. We had also planned to take the stools to an upholstery shop to have the backs recovered. But Leather Like New took care of that as well. Thank you Fred, Brett, Chris, and the whole crew. You guys did an amazing job. Great prices and great service. They did what they say they were going to do, they answered the phone every time we called, and even update us along the way. Nice work.",Positive
"I had a high end sofa and love that had seen better days. They were still very comfortable, so I thought I'd have them cleaned and conditioned. The company that came over to clean them said they were beyond repair. Leather Like New was recommended and both pieces now look good as new...I kid you not. It's unbelievable what they did to each piece. Thanks guys for an amazing and incredible job.",Positive
"I hired Leather Like New to reupholstered a chair. The back cushion in cowhide and the seat in leather. The leather seat turned out fine, however the cowhide has a severe crease from the top to bottom. First of all, I don't understand why Fred did not choose a better piece of cowhide and secondly, when I brought this to his attention he said he couldn't do anything about it. He stated it may soften with time or it may not. Very disappointed that he was unwilling to take a look at it or try to remedy the situation. The chair looks unprofessional and people have commented on the imperfection. Would not recommend.",Negative
"Absolutely fantastic, the best money we've ever spent! Chris, Roberto and Fred were wonderful to deal with, very quick to respond to my initial inquiry and within 10 days from start to finish, our 12-yr. old leather couch and loveseat are back, looking just like new. Both pieces had several worn spots and, scratches (many from cats!) and even a tear, but you'd never know it to see them now. Customer service is excellent - Chris explained the repair process in detail, and they did just what they said they would do. Pricing seemed more than reasonable to us, and even the loaner couch we were given was very nice. It's very rare for our expectations to be met in terms of quality of work and customer service when dealing with service companies, but Leather Like New far exceeded them with their professionalism and craftsmanship. I can't recommend them highly enough! Many, many thanks guys!!",Positive
"Love this company. Fred, the owner is a true professional. These guys know what they are doing. I would trust them with any sort of leather no matter the uniqueness of the piece or the severity of the damage. Keep it up guys!",Positive
"Great customer service and top notch work! I had several pieces of furniture in need of repair. Some required wood working, others new upholstery, and another requiring leather treatment. All of the work was done quickly and expertly. Fred and the team were professional and courteous. I have no idea how they made the leather chair 'like new' but they did it. We've had the furniture back in our house for a few weeks now and I am 100% satisfied.",Positive
"If I could give zero stars, I would. This guy is a joke. I have been waiting to have my expensive leather sectional repaired for a very small stain since MAY 21st. My couch is under warranty, and both the company and I have had no luck in getting Fred to call us back. The repair is covered, and the guy should get paid. So why am I getting the run-around? I initially called to inquire about their services, and was told I would receive a call the next day to set up an appointment for Fred to come out to my home. One week, then two weeks go by - so I called and was told ""oh, I thought you were already set up?"" So by this time, he was booked out for 2 weeks. So I waited a total of 4 weeks before he came out to look at the piece. Fred was over an hour late for our ""appointment"" and seemed rushed and irritated when he was here. He wanted to take the piece of my sectional back to his shop to fix it, although previously he told me he could fix it on site. He kept going back and forth on what he wanted to do. In addition, he couldn't give me an estimate but told me that it would probably be more than what my warranty would allow. When I balked at this, he finally decided to not take my furniture (I wouldn't have allowed him anyway considering I probably wouldn't get it back for another 4 weeks). He told me that I would receive a call the next day with the estimate. Not surprisingly, AGAIN the call never came. This was JUNE 25th. I called my furniture company's warranty line and explained the situation. They called Leather Like New directly and also never received a call back, and I have since been looking for other services as now it is JULY 29th and my piece is still stained. I am so frustrated. Fred's excuse over and over was that he is ""busy."" I am a professional and we are all busy! Customer service here is horrible; I felt pushed off, and honestly lied to about when I would get calls back. I have called and left messages about my dissatisfaction. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CALLS OR EXPRESSIONS OF REMORSE IN REGARDS TO HOW I HAVE BEEN TREATED. Fred will not be busy for long. I will never be recommending his services, or lack thereof for that matter. If you want to be treated appropriately and with respect, and to have something done in a timely manner, please look elsewhere.",Negative
i found leather like new from the yelp reviews and fred is wonderful! he picked up my couch cushion and even delivered it back to me! he did a great job repairing it and was so sweet to teach me how to clean my couch as well. his staff was also very nice and helpful! i would def recommend leather like new to anyone! give fred a try you wont be disappointed!,Positive
I contacted them to replace the springs on my leather couch. At first they seemed really helpful and interested in the work. I talked to the owner who was supposed to call me back to schedule when to come look at the couch and take it to their shop. That phone call never happened. I even called and left a message with the receptionist and he never called back. So the next day I called again and talked to him. He didn't care at all that he didn't call me back. He flatly told me that he was busy and that I was 1 of 20 people he needed to call or that had called him. Great that he is that busy but if he continues to disregard potential customers like he did me he won't be busy for much longer.,Negative
"Where do I start with the major issues and down right crappy service I got here. Let's start with they scratched the rims, then they said oh we will fix them... yeah they covered half of the scratches then said ""oh that wasn't us"" like completely screwing me over for THEIR mistakes! DON'T go here!!",Negative
"Got the alignment and a rotation of tires done (actually, the rotation had to be rescheduled because the wheel locks weren't in the car - but the management was very accommodating giving me the possibility to bring the car back to get it done in a different day). Staff was friendly and the service was done quickly. Price was fair and cheaper than what was asked at the car dealer. Previously I got a set of 4 run flat tires for a different car and the price was also good.",Positive
"The best experience I've ever had at an auto repair shop. I've lived in Charlotte for 6.5 years and this has been by far the best shop I've been to. I called after realizing I had a flat tire and they told me to come right away and they would get it taken care of for me. I arrived and Danielle (Dani) at the front desk was so nice and helpful. I was given an estimated wait time of 1.5-2 hrs (not ideal as this was a Tuesday and I had back to back meetings all day) and they finished in 20 mins. The waiting area could use a little work, but I will absolutely return here in the future. Highly recommend.",Positive
"5 star service. Best mechanics and garage in Charlotte. I love being able to drop off my car anytime and leaving the keys in the Dropbox with instructions. Front desk, mechanic and manager are hard working and extremely knowledgeable. I have been coming here for years and trust them completely. They fixed my Cadillac SUV in about 3-4 hours. Had a heater and defroster problem. They knew exactly what to do and saved me a lot of money. Cadillac would have charged me 2-3 times as much. I would not go anywhere else and I will treat them to pizzas in a week or two. Their honesty is incredible. Kudos to McCarthy for hiring the right people. The garage itself is spotless and organized.",Positive
"They have saved me multiple times! I came out of work today to see I had a flat tire. With some help, I got the spare on and saw 2 nails in tire. Crap. It was 3:45. I called McCarthy since I live on the same block as them and they said they could try to get it done but they closed at 6 and have several cars waiting. I crossed my fingers and went there anyways. I dropped my car off around 4:00 and by 5:40 they had my tire patched (only one patch was needed) and they put the tire back on. All that cost $25. They saved me! I will recommend them to anyone!",Positive
"I live in the neighborhood down the street from McCarthy's. I thought they were a decent business until they tried to charge me $105 just to plug in an OBD to test a check engine light to see what the problem was. My battery had recently died and I was thinking something needed to be reset. I was also informed that anything beyond this (including a simple reset) would be an additional charge. I drove down the road to Autozone, got a free test and free reset. I will not be recommending or using McCarthy's ever again.",Negative
"Worst service ever. Place has went downhill. Kept my car 2 1/2 days and still didn't fix the issue! First, they said the coil had to be replaced and recommended replacing the plugs but it wasn't necessary (BTW..they wanted to charge $210 for just the plugs!!) They replaced the coil and I literally drove it off the lot, down the road, not even a mile and my car is missing gears and light are flashing. Take it back and a different guy suggested that all plugs need to be replaced after coil replacement. Total miscommunication on their part. Save your money and time, go somewhere else.",Negative
Went here for NC car inspection. They said the car failed and needed a $1500.00 repair. Took car to two other inspection stations and they both said the same thing: nope your car is great in that regard but McCarthy missed the emergency brake not working. The cost is $350. This place is a ripoff big time.,Negative
"Was recommended this place by a friend and now I see why. I'm a busy girl with a crazy schedule so when I called on a Tuesday in the middle of the afternoon and they were able to take me right away they were already off to a good start. Online they have a plethora of coupons from 20% off for first time customers to $10-20 bucks off of a variety of oil changes. I'm all about finding a good deal. Not only did they change my oil in an hour, but they found a nail in my tire, patched it, and replaced the battery on my autostart for just about $100. Fast, efficient, affordable and trust worthy. I will absolutely be back.",Positive
Two week old tire. I purchased 4 new tires and left my house. Traveled about three miles and the car started shaking. I pulled over immediately to this. I took the tire and car back to McCarthys and was treated very unprofessional from the beginning. They did not go look at the tire claimed I had to have hit something or had nail without even inspecting it. They told me thy would not replace the tire without me having to pay for it. I am having to dispute the charges with my credit card company and having an attorney review it because 700 is a lot of money when you did NOT hit anything. I went to me nobody in Gastonia Basically that brand warranties the tire for 50% of tread period. They were supposed to give me a new tire. They are one of the only authorized Hercules dealers in a certain vicinity and he is calling the rep to let them know they are not honoring there word and basically ripping people off. Taking their money for a new tire when the manufacturer gives a free one. They put a new tire on at a different shop for free!!!!! DO NOT BUY TIRES HERE. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DISHONEST. also said it was a zipper effect. The tire wasn't inflated properly and it was from running on low pressure. Keep in mind they insisted I hit something and would not look at the tire. The other shop Inspected the tire and could tell there was no nail and nothing had been hit.,Negative
"Absolutely awful. Just went there for an oil change, had an apt at 9 and just got my car back at 12:30. After ignoring me for hours and saying ""itll be done soon"" everytime i'd ask they finally said they were out of oil filers and had to wait for more to get there. Will never go back here again, thank you for wasting half of my day off.",Negative
"Best service I've ever gotten. Being a female and not educated in the area of automobiles, I was treated with extreme kindness and compassion. I will recommend this business to everyone.",Positive
They did a great job! and even offered me a ride back to work when I had to leave my car there for a few hours! Really excellent job! :),Positive
DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! I REPEAT DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! They are scammers! Two weeks prior to taking my car to this shop I received a tire inspection from another shop which said I needed to replace three tires. I didn't have time to do repairs so two weeks later I took car to this place because it's close to my job. They said I needed all four tires replaces which I knew was a lie because prior inspection and tire was only a year old. I told them not to replace and I would get my car and take it to a honest establishment. When I pickled my car up one tire was totally flat and the good tire was removed from car with them claiming it was too bad for me to put on the car and I needed to buy 4 tires ASAP! I knew this was a scam! It was amazing that I dove there with no problem and when I went to pick car up its on milk crates! I told them I was an lawyer had seen this scam before and they changed their tune. As I sat in the waiting room I heard them do the same song and dance with two other people. It was so sickening I finally told the next lady walking into don't waste her time. They are dishonest! I'm passing the same advice on to you!,Negative
"I have been here several times to get an oil change and have had nothing but amazing service. More recently I brought my car in to have the oil pan gasket replaced, and again everyone who worked their was super helpful, friendly, honest and knowledgeable. They had quoted me one price, but when they called with the estimate after seeing the vehicle, they let me know it would be less!!! That type of honesty really meant a lot. They also kept me updated throughout the entire process. They are absolutely the only place I will bring my car in Charlotte!! Thank you again for an amazing job!!",Positive
this place is the worse. I paid for an alignment that they obliviously didn't do ruining the two new tires I bought. STAY AWAY!,Negative
"These guys are outstanding. I took my car in for what ended up being a major surgery--eventually had to replace the entire rear end of my 2008 GT Mustang. Despite the complexity of the repairs, Robert (head technician) made sure I knew exactly what was happening and why. At one point, he and Kyle (manager) took me underneath the car with a stethoscope (not kidding) so I could hear the internal grinding in the rear axle shaft, then plotted out a diagram for me of what was happening. They got the repair work done expertly and efficiently, and with parts that are under warranty. The costs could have easily ballooned into several thousands of dollars, but they worked really hard to keep them down and the price was more than reasonable. What's more, we eventually figured out that the problem was due to poor repair work performed two years before by a different shop on consignment. McCarthy provided tons of assistance in my quest to have the responsible insurance company pony up. They pulled all the parts out so I could take pictures and even gave me a written statement about it. End result: car runs like greased lightning and the insurance company paid up. To say they went above and beyond is an understatement--I can't imagine having had a better experience. I've been back several times since then for minor repairs and the result is always the same. Efficient and high-quality work, very fair pricing, and outstanding service. If you need minor maintenance and service done, they'll do a great job and have some of the best pricing in town (I checked). If you need major repair work done, they'll tackle that, too. Five emphatic stars.",Positive
"Came here hoping to get a tire patched for my brother's car. They weren't allowed to patch as there was sidewall damage. However, the put the spare on in 5 minutes free of charge with no hope of selling me a tire. Amazing customer service!",Positive
"Great service - I took my car in for an oil change, two tires and an alignment. The manager Kyle was super friendly and took the time to explain my options with the oil changes and discuss pricing. When my car was there, they checked it out and told me other small issues that were wrong with it. No pressure to get the services done, just hey, an FYI and we'll be glad to help you when you are ready for these services. Appreciated the kind service and felt as though the prices were quite reasonable, especially after calling around. Next time I need service, I'd be happy to take my jeep there.",Positive
"I purchased 2 front tires and an alignment for my 2000 Toyota Solara for $352. While driving home, I noticed a vibration when braking and the wheel was shaking. A week later, I bring it back, thinking they will fix whatever they did wrong the first time. I get a call informing me my front rotors are warped and I need new ones. The car was fine when I drove it there and even minutes before pulling into their lot. Yet after I picked it up, it was not handling well. Is THAT a COINCIDENCE? McCarthy rep, Justin, said yes. All things that could potentially cause rotors to warp; temperature, extreme weather, aggressive driving and over torquing lug nuts - the only possible factor that day is over torquing. McCarthy tire incorrectly installed my 2 front tires and refused to take responsibility for their negligence.",Negative
"It is so hard to find a good and honest service station these days and McCarthy tire is one of them! They don't try to sell you what you don't need, the prices are great, and they are fast! I love that they actually ask me when I need my car back by! The location is also great for anyone that lives or works uptown and walk ins are welcome. Great place!",Positive
"Do NOT bring your car here! I brought my car here to get a tire replaced and ended up being told my alignment was now off and couldn't be fixed, though they couldn't find anything wrong with the car. The second time I brought it here, the tires were rotated and balanced. My car began to shake at higher speeds...like the alignment was really off. I took my car to another shop where I was told that not only was my alignment off, but it had been off for a bit...likely since my last visit to McCarthy, and it had caused ALL my tires to wear severely and irregularly. My tires replaced and alignment FIXED without problems...they couldn't figure out why McCarthy said they couldn't fix my alignment. Now my car drives like normal. BEWARE!!! Update: The manager of this location contacted me and seemed genuinely concerned. He wanted to make things right. We discussed the situation at length and he remedied things to my satisfaction. I will definitely give McCarthy another shot.",Negative
"Yes, I am a stereotypical female who admittedly does not know, nor do I care to know much about the internal workings of my car. I make no secret of that fact when I am in repair shops. The guys at McCarthy Tire are fast, respectful and won't charge you for services you don't need. I take my car here for oil changes, tire rotations and minor repairs & have always been pleased with the speedy and courteous service. I also appreciate the fact that they don't roll their eyes (at least while I'm standing there) when I refer to various parts of my car as a ""thingy"" or a ""flap thing."" Should I learn more about the mechanics my car? ...Absolutely... Will I? Probably not ...but thanks to McCarthy Tire, my decision to remain ignorant is a little less frightening.",Positive
"My car just stopped working and I had no idea what happened, the people at McCarthy's were so great! They explained what the problem was and did not take advantage of me! (Which has happened to me before when dealing with car repairs). Every staff member was helpful and they even reassured me with a number that I could reach after hours! I highly recommend this establishment and it was reasonably priced and right in uptown.",Positive
"i have had previous work done with this company and good work, but this time i was very disappointed. had procomp upper control arms put on my tundra and had mcm have it aligned as well and he used a alignment shop he trusts. when i picked the truck up i noticed from the get go the truck was pulling to the right. i contacted the owner and told him and he said to let him know if it was still driving funny a couple days later. couple days roll around and it still is. i let him know and he said he would get in contact with the alignment shop. 3 weeks later, i ask him if he talked to them. the owner never responded to me originally and told me to call the shop when it's not my responsibility to get his mistake taken care of. i finally said i'm calling them myself and got it taken care of. i won't do business or recommend anyone to mcm fab cause of poor customer service.",Negative
Small business matters. Matt and his guys do phenomenal work and turn around time is outstanding. They do what you want and will offer options if you're unsure of exactly what you wan to do. I bring my 4x4 here for suspension stuffs. They've done my last two trucks and the build quality is outstanding.,Positive
"Matt at MCM Fab is the man to go to for anything ADS Racing Suspension related! My buddy had sent me over to Matt to consult regarding my suspension upgrade / lift on my 2014 Toyota Tacoma. Matt is a vendor for ADS and is one of the main 3rd party R&D guys for them. I reached out to Matt a few months ago and told him what I was looking for in terms of the overall build for my truck. He suggested some parts and after doing a little research on my own, I decided to go with his recommendation. I live in the SF Bay Area (about an 8-9 hour drive each way) but I was planning to head into vegas for some family events anyways, combine that with the fact that the installed price from Matt was only $100 more than just purchasing the parts and shipping it to me and having to figure out how to install it myself or pay more for a shop to do it, I decided to just have him install it. I sent him a deposit and booked an installation appointment. We had a date set (last week) and he said I would have the truck back within 24 hours. So 24 hours for the complete suspension install (shocks/springs, Upper control arms, leaf pack, spindle gussets, CMC) and alignment. I told him I'd be in town all weekend so he didn't need to rush. I dropped off the truck at 8:30am on a Friday morning and he was basically done with the install (minus alignment) by 6pm that same day! I couldn't believe he was done already. I eventually grab the truck the next day and see her in all her glory. Matt did an awesome job! What struck me more than the quality of his work was his customer service. His shop is only a few minutes away from the hotels on the south end of the strip (MGM, Aria, Luxor, etc). He offered to drop me off and pick me up from the hotel, saving me a cab ride. Additionally, he sent me text messages with pictures of the truck during the day. That was totally unexpected. Lastly, he sent me a text 4 days after the install to see how the truck was riding and to make sure everything was good. Matt is a GREAT dude and I HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking for fabrication work or off roading suspension work.",Positive
Great shop. I bring my 2014 tundra to Matt at mcm and he always takes care of me. Amazing work with great customer service,Positive
The go to spot for Offroad fabrication. Matt also does a great amount general fabrication for all types of fabrication needs from conventions to concert stages and props.,Positive
They sold my mom who is on a fixed income a car from this place and they replaced the tires but they left a rotting split spare tire. They also told her that they aligned the car but when we looked at it the rear back tire was way out of line. We took it to a place we trusted to get it aligned and the mechanic said there is no way Mesa Motors did an alignment because the rack was so messed up they could not have done one with out replacing the rack. Just the regular average used car dealers screwing over someone on a fixed income. Way to keep up the crappy reputation of a used car lot.,Negative
"Look, Adam Greenfield was real nice, and it was a nice place and the car was a great deal, it's not a bad place to buy a car. NO HASSLE! Before the car had it's problem i was very happy with Mesa Motors, I even posted a great review on Facebook, and i never do that and trust me it's way BETTER THAN CRAIGSLIST, that's a true junk yard what junk cars people are selling. Adam did go out of his way to put the deal together, what's sad is i really love this car. it's what happened after the sale is what is going on, if they refund me my money or do more then just hang up i would not be changing my first review, The car fax report shows a car that was destroyed and i can't sell it being a good Christian. It runs, but over heats with in a few miles and the wiring harness is fried and i spent $107.87 for a new battery along with the new floor mats, seat covers oil change. The car books for $5500.00 if in good shape, i got the car for $2500.00 out the door, it was day 14 that the car was no longer driveable and the car won't pass state smog so, this is what put's this deal upside down. i would run a car fax report on ANY used car before you buy from ANYONE. Come on, return my money or get me into another car. I have sent friend from my church to buy from them so, this tells you their nice, even for used car dealers selling on Car Fax.com are selling worse it's what it is, excuse the pun, USED CAR SALESMEN! LOL Steve St Clair",Positive
I would like to say how amazing buying a car they have made my experience. After being treated like a dollar sign at many of the large dealerships I ran back to Mesa Motors to buy from them. They have a customer for LIFE. I'm so confidant in my decision I will send my daughters to them as well.,Positive
Mesa Motors sold us a car for our daughter and later a car to our nephew. Talked us out of cars that weren't the right fit. Have total trust in this organization. Client for life!,Positive
This place is horrible I'm a purple heart vet from Iraq. Spent the only money I had to get a car and they sold me a piece of crap. Over heated on the 1 at day the end and 5th day as well never fixed right and engine locked up on me. Andrew brown the owner called me said he wants to make it right. But you can never get ahold of him. Call mesa motors to try and contact him as well. Leave messages to have gin call you never does. We the vets fight for freedom to come home to a place like this that treats vets like this. They should not be allowed to have a business.,Negative
"Ladies, if you need a car, go here. I recently traded in my 2004 Ford Ranger in for a 2006 Mercury Mountaineer and couldn't be more pleased at the level of service I received. From the time I called and spoke to Andrew to signing the papers for the new-to-us car, we were treated with respect. (As a woman, that is rarely the case when I've bought a car.) Through each step of the process with Nick and Brady at Mesa Motors treated me as a valued customer, asking questions to find me the vehicle to fit my needs. It was a refreshing experience . I recommend Mesa Motors to everyone I know.",Positive
They have a great selection. I found a car and they helped me find financing with my rocky credit. The car had a minor issue arise after I had the car for a week. Adam was very helpful in getting me right in to get the problem taken care of at no cost to me. I have recommended them to anyone who asks me where I got my car.,Positive
Be careful about this place they screw with the cars and try to charge you for it. They messed with my check engine light so that the codes can't be read so you can't fix it yourself... They have now said that they will do no work on my van that I purchased from them all because I wrote a bad review. Here's a thought want a good review do good work don't just pass the buck... So be sure you call Andrew the owner and ask how he will discriminate against you for having a bad experience. Talk about unprofessional..... If I wanted a temper tantrum I would have gone to a preschool... Although now I know and am warning you stay away from Mesa motors and brown and brown you will regret it if you buy a car from them.,Negative
"What a great place to buy a car. I got what car I wanted and they were able to help reestablish my credt. I hate buying cars, but now thanks to Mesa Motors I have a dealership that I can trust.",Positive
"Yet again, I was so very pleased with the service I received at this wonderful shop. Both Mike and Carlos were as friendly as ever, and they make a customer feel very comfortable, offering coffee and making absolutely sure that everyone receives perfect service.I I began my connection with them a few years ago when I had an emergency in the dead of winter with one of my car windows. Just returning from a hospital appointment, I noticed the business and drove right in. Needless to say, they fixed the window and advised me of how poorly it had been repaired from a past experience. They did NOT criticize, but, professionally explained the issue at hand. I have visited since, for different vehicle concerns, and was shown respect and speedy service. I love this place. It exudes security and respect in all ways. Love Mary also. She always deals with my calls in a very professional manner. Easy to recommend this location. It is wonderful. Donna N.",Positive
Terrifically helpful and accommodating staff. They really seem to go the extra mile to serve. Even for minor issues. Excellent customer service. Highly recommended.,Positive
"Very friendly, polite, and knowledgeable staff. I'm new to the area but have made them my mechanics. Carlos who works at the front seems to be a cool and down to earth guy, always in a good happy mood. Mike the manager is informative and fair, I was quoted an amount that when I paid was actually less, he didn't fix what didn't need to be fixed. The shop waiting area is clean and they offer coffee, but if you like east on Hwy 7 on Woodstream Blvd is a Tim Hortons. Through my observation the staff here appears to be happy. The wait time has been fair depending on the service required and day of the week. I personally recommend them, or at least give them a try and see if what I've said is true. If you ever have to borrow a car when yours is being serviced, ask for Carlos red Lamborghini, he will be more then happy to lend it to you... obviously I'm just kidding.",Positive
"I think it was the worst experience I ever had with a car shop in my life. I came for a routine oil change and also asked to check my brakes. I was told to pickup my car at 4 pm (they were open until 4pm). When I arrived at 4pm I saw the mechanic taking my car for service! 40 min later my car was ready. They didn't check my breaks like I asked them to but I just let it go. When I was driving home I noticed my car was making weird clucking noice and then it stopped and I couldn't turn it on! Eventually I was able to turn it on and drive to my place. Next day I called them and brought my car back. They promised to fix it, but never did. The car stayed at the shop for a week and during that time they kept giving me different information every time I called. Eventually my vehicle was taken into a different shop and fixed (I paid quite a bit of money). I would NEVER trust them with my vehicle again, and would never recommend this location to anyone!",Negative
I have been here a few times to have emission tests done. The manager Mike is very friendly and courteous as well as the other staff. I was able to book my appointment online and was called promptly to confirm.,Positive
"First time coming here, as I usually go to my mechanic who's actually my uncle. My Car is an 07 Nissan Versa, and it been making loud noises when I drive, but my uncle is on vacation and I'm usually hesitant to go to auto shops in fear that they might over charge me. On this occasion I knew I couldn't afford to wait for my uncle to come back because my car was REALLY really loud when I would drive. Found Midas in Woodbridge on Yelp and saw they had good reviews, and thought I'd give them a shot. Mike and Carlos were really helpful and honest. They even offer you free coffee :) They showed me exactly what the issue was with my Nissan, and didn't try to oversell me on anything. My catalytic converter was almost rusted off, but they offered to weld it for me for a fair price as opposed to replacing the whole thing for crazy $$$. I will most likely come back here for any future services.",Positive
"There was a screw that punctured the tread on one of my tires. After reading the reviews on this Midas, I can agree that this place is definitely one of the best in auto repair. They were polite, professional and descriptive in explaining what they had to do to fix the puncture. Unlike the other places I've been to, they do not try to make you pay for extra services. I recommend this place for any automotive repairs without any of the usual worries.",Positive
"These are the best guys to take your car to. Very friendly, professional and honest. Mike and Tina are absolutely amazing. Fourth time coming here. Took me in as a walkin and also saved me $400 compared to what the dealership was charging for a brake job. Cause it took a little longer than I thought and I had to pick up my wife from work, Mike offered me his car to pick her up and both he and Tina insisted on it after my refusal. Even though I moved further away, I will most definitely make the drive to this place for work on both my and my wife's car.",Positive
"Best car service I have ever had. If you need a shop you can really trust, come here. They have saved me hundreds in repairs that I don't need, taught my a lot about my car and earned a veey loyal customer in the process. Every person on their staff is cheerful, funny, personable and eager to serve. You can't ask for more!",Positive
"Recently visited this Midas location as a ""walk-in"" to have my oil changed in my Volkswagen Jetta and I was very happy with the customer service I received! I will definitely continue to bring my vehicle to Mike and the team for maintenance. As a young female, I didn't feel that I was being taken advantage of - and Mike was even kind enough to explain things to me as well! I truly appreciated their friendly ""family"" approach. Like a previous reviewer stated, they don't seem to ""up-sell"" you on unnecessary repairs. I went in for an oil change, received just that, and they didn't mention the need for any extras!",Positive
"This is the place for inspections, they are extremely efficient and fast. Have been going here for 7 yrs. never had a problem",Positive
This is the most efficient inspection station I have ever been to. I was in and out in 10 minutes. Can't get much better,Positive
First time to have a vehicle inspection and i checked for a reputable place. Mr Inspection is that establishment. Three inspectors checked my 2010 Van. I was finished in ten minutes and on my way.,Positive
"Fantastic service.!!! I pulled up at 4:55, five minutes before close on a Thursday and they took my car right off, no attitude no side eye, just fast and friendly service. They fixed some lightbulb issues that would have caused my inspection to fail, and it was super reasonable. They even gave me a suggestion of something that I should probably get fixed, that was very minor, but could potentially become a problem for next year's inspection. I was in and out in 12 minutes! I would recommend them 1000 times, hands-down best inspection ever.",Positive
"As far as vehicle inspection businesses go, this place is hard to beat. It's convenient, friendly and jiffy quick. I believe they've even spruced up the waiting area with new chairs, carpeting and a nice TV. The young lady behind the counter is friendly and efficient. Would recommend to anyone needing a vehicle inspection.",Positive
"I've gone here for the last 5+ years for all three of my vehicles to get inspected. They have a full crew of about 5 guys working on Saturday, therefore you don't waste any of your time. You get in and out in approximately 15-20 minutes. They have always been honest with me and are extremely courteous. I would recommend these guys to anyone and everyone.",Positive
"I'm a young adult female, and they were not honest with me. They went so far as to, while lying to my face about something that ""needed to be fixed"", hand me a business card and recommend a guy saying ""he's honest."" After I realized what went on, that in particular seemed very scummy. I wouldn't have known better but I asked my dad for help thankfully. Once they saw I was having my dad work on my car and that I wouldn't be paying anyone to ""fix"" anything, they passed my vehicle. I won't go into a long story but it was obvious they were trying to rip me off. They are fast though. If you appear to not be knowledgeable about cars though they will try to take advantage",Negative
I used to be in the auto repair business years ago and I highly recommend Mr Inspection in Matthews. They are honest and will not find something that is not there. They have a full crew of 4 guys and you get in and out fast. PLEASE dont take your car for an inspection to any of the chains because you will be fleeced! Clark Tire Indian Trail found things that did not need repair.,Positive
"In and out in no time..... If you are looking for a quick car inspection without blowing half the day waiting in line go here. I usually go Saturday mornings (early) to avoid the rush, but they seem to handle the 20 guy rush in the mornings (I guess great minds do think alike). The waiting room was recently revamped with a tv and chairs... before it looked kinda bad and dingy... like I haven't been cleaned in 20 years dingy. You don't really spend too much time in the waiting room anyway, but at least it's an option.",Positive
"I trust these guys. Tim is honest and straightforward, the quality of work is high and they always get the job done with urgency. I wish I remembered the names of the service crew so I could thank them. High recommendation.",Positive
"As usual Tim and George get it right always. You could not ask for better customer service. And the work is perfect. The quote was actually higher, and there was more work done. Brakes. Best garage in the area.",Positive
"As a somewhat new resident to Lakewood, I was in need of car service and found Mr Tire to be highly rated. The owner, George cuts the BS and tells you how it is (that is, if you can get something done cheaper elsewhere). On my recent visit they went out of their way on customer service to make sure I had a tire the next day. I will definitely continue to give them my business as they have earned it.",Positive
"The guys at Mr. Tire are wonderful. My husband and I been taking our cars here for more than 3 years and have never had a bad experience. The customer service is excellent and they are extremely friendly and trustworthy which is why I keep coming back. Yes, it's frustrating when you go in for an oil change and your car has more problems than anticipated and it costs more, but the guys here--especially George & Tim--are so helpful and try to get costs down as much as possible. They take the time to talk over the exact issues and make recommendations, as well as show you the replaced part and why it was unsafe. They can also recommend shops around the area if you need exhaust or other work. Highly recommended!",Positive
"Courteous knowledgeable staff. The manager always keeps me informed on the progress of the work being preformed, with estimated times. Ive never had to bring my car back for work theyve done. I also do my own research on maintenance and never felt taken advantage of. I highly appreciate the quality performance of the staff and the manager.",Positive
"This is the only place I will bring my car. I never feel like I'm being taken advantage of and I've only had great experiences. George is so great. He's friendly, honest and you can tell really takes pride in what he does. He makes recommendations based on what's best for you and your situation and I've never seen him try to up sell anything. I've had oil changes, breaks, and new tires put on at Mr. Tire. They've earned my trust and business.",Positive
"Dropped my car off for an oil change on the fly. Tim was very nice over the phone and was able to schedule me same-day. This location is very close to the 55 bus line so I was able to drop off my car and still make it into work on time! Great price, $26 out the door for my oil change w/ inspection and tire rotation. This location is open until after 7p making it ideal for office zombies in need of pick ups after 5. I'm very impressed with the friendly service I received. As a woman, I worry about the myriad of ""problems"" that will be found when I leave my car somewhere for a simple service. Tim called to express a concern about my muffler. After a quick chat and more detailed inspection all was deemed a-ok and he even left a hand written note to let me know all was well. I'll certainly be returning! Thanks the great experience.",Positive
"These guys are awesome. As a woman, I am always worried that I will get ripped off at mechanics because their assumption that I know nothing about cars is spot-on! These guys are honest and will discuss what is best for your situation rather than just trying to sell you stuff. I purchased all new tires from a different Mr. Tire and when I ran over a nail, they patched the tire up for me for free in no time. If you're looking for someone you can trust to work on your car, I highly recommend you see George at Mr. Tire. He is professional, courteous, and friendly not to mention knowledgeable and fair. He expressed to me that his goal as manager of the Lakewood Mr. Tire was to turn all the negative reviews online into positive ones. So here's to helping you on your way to achieving your goal!",Positive
"I blew my tire while I was in the middle of moving out of Cleveland. I had to stick the spare on and grab a hotel for the night at the Days Inn in Lakewood. Fortunately for me, Mr. Tires was right next door. The next day, I came in at 7:30 am and had the super friendly manager take a look. He said I had a leak on the side wall and could just repair the tire versus replacing it. Mr Tires saved me $100+. He could've sold me a tire and made more money. There aren't too many honest auto guys in the world, but luckily for us we have Mr. Tires.",Positive
"I really hate dealing with my car. I have no idea how to fix it when something happens, and it's pretty obvious how clueless I am. I really appreciate it when garages treat me with respect and don't try to take advantage of my ignorance. I've had some mixed experiences at Mr. Tire. The first couple times I went there, the owner/manager was very kind to me, explained my options, and gave me a good deal. The last time I went I worked with someone else, and I was pretty disappointed with the service. I needed a muffler, so I made an appointment online. They called and asked if I could bring it in a day before so they could take measurements and get the parts ready and give me an estimate. I did. Then I brought it back on my scheduled appointment day. They didn't have my appointment in the books, forgot to take measurements when I brought it in the first time (What did they do instead? Take pictures of my car and give me a laundry list of other things wrong with my car), and didn't have an estimate. I had a price point in mind for my muffler based on what some people told me. When I finally got my estimate, it was more than $100 of what I was expecting. Needless to say, I took my broken car someplace else. Definitely didn't appreciate how they wasted my time. Maybe I should try to learn more about cars? But I'd rather find a trustworthy place to take my car. Maybe I'll go back there, but it probably won't be my first choice.",Positive
"Ive been here a couple of times now. Got some rubbers. Employees there have been nice, and they don't crack any smart-ass jokes about your car. Which I hate at other establishments. Prices are good, can't complain. I made an appointment and was in-n-out in under 30min. They do a great job. Ill keep going back when i need to.",Positive
"I took my car in to be serviced three, I repeat, THREE times on suspicion of slow leaks in my tires. On every single occasion, they claimed they couldn't find anything. Last night I got stranded in the middle of nowhere with - you guessed it - a flat. Conclusion from Midas? HUGE leaks in ALL FOUR TIRES. How they missed giant leaks in every single tire is beyond me. Don't go here.",Negative
"I went in for tires & it seemed like a pretty staright forward type of transaction. After they put on $400 worth of tires, they informed me i needed over $800 of work before they could do my alignment. The issues they discovered that needed fixing should have been obvious as soon as my old tires came off. They didn't call me to tell me of the issue. My husband told them to keep their new tires & put my old ones back on, as we are not going to invest $1100 in a car that is 13 years old. I have never in 20 years of having a car, had a garage not call me when an issue such as this was discovered. I realize my car is crappy & assumed there were issues, but my problem was no one thought to call me. Doesn't it make sense that one might decide not to invest in $400 worth of tires if their car may be a death trap?When my husband inquired as to why they didn't call us, they said they had & i told them to do the tires. However, when they called me the tires were done & they were just informing me of all the other work that was needed. I am still waiting to see how this plays out as i still have to pick up my car tonight, with my old crappy tires. I am not a happy camper here. Per a text from my husband, they car should be done by 5 & I am not getting charged. I guess thats fair, but the road to fair was not fun.",Negative
"Fantastic help at Mr. Tire today. I'm moving to San Francisco in a week and selling my car before I leave. Just my luck, I get a screw stuck in my tire leaving it as flat as can be. The screw was too far from the tire center to get repaired and I was pretty ticked that I was going to have to replace a tire on a car I'm only gonna own for another week. Mr. Tire calls me back up 15 minutes later and says they don't usually do anything with used tires, but based on my circumstances they've figured something out. $20 later and I have a new used tire (in fantastic condition) and can go about my final week driving. I was floored at how far out of their way they went to take care of my particular situation! Wonderful job!",Positive
"This place tends to be very expensive for something like an oil change, but they do a lot more than just oil changes. For cheap, simple things this place seems pricey, but I often found that for more extensive work, I can get a much lower price here than elsewhere. In particular, I found that they were very good at working on my older Volvo and were just as effective as foreign specialist mechanics at working on the car and locating parts. And of course they were much cheaper than a dealer, and more convenient to deal with. As a last item of praise, this place is honest. I had trouble with my car starting once and the mechanic fixed the problem immediately upon inspecting the car, without replacing any parts, and did not charge me anything.",Positive
"Great experience! Special thanks to Mike and Terri for taking care of me. I was rear-ended this past summer in Chicago and unfortunately, the other party had American Alliance insurance. Prior to coming to Mr. Auto Body, I spent over three months trying to contact American Alliance regarding my settlement payments. Mike and Terri handled this issue for me, kept me constantly in the loop, and were able to obtain three separate settlement checks over the course of a month. They did a great job fixing my rear bumper and their repair costs were substantially cheaper than quotes from other body shops. I would definitely recommend you check out this shop.",Positive
"A shotty masonry company damaged my vehicle while it was parked on the street then took almost 3 months to respond for me to get a claim check. Throughout the process the entire crew at Mr. Auto Body was informative, patient and understanding while tending to my situation. They ordered the parts to repair my car weeks before I actually got the claim check in the mail and were still happy to work around my schedule when it came time for repairs. On top of all that, they did in TWO DAYS what some body shops were saying would take almost a full week and $400+ more dollars to do. I'm not one to write reviews, but I truly believe those at Mr. Auto Body deserve to be recognized for their outstanding service.",Positive
"Best body shop in Champaign! Friendly people, great work, fast and efficient! The whole team is knowledgeable, kind, helpful, and really cares about you and your car. I absolutely recommend using them!",Positive
"They do good cosmetic work, but after I was in an accident and brought my car there, they just didn't seem to care much about my situation and talked down to me a lot. I was told my car needed an alignment so it would be two days longer (which it had been two weeks already for a simple part). Literally 4 days later I took it to O'Brien for a scheduled maintenance and decided to have an alignment check just in case. Well the alignment was far off, which was terribly upsetting since Mr. Autobody insisted they keep my car longer to fix this, and gave me a car that was not properly aligned. I don't trust this business and would strongly suggest shopping around.",Negative
"I scratched my car and went shopping for repairs. I went to Tatmen's and the quote was $1400+, but at Mr. Auto Body it was $700. The owner of Mr. Auto Body is not only very professional, but also very nice. He actually offered to fix my family's other car for free since the scratches were slight.",Positive
Had a great experience. Very polite. (Tony) discussed everything as he was going along found some serious cracks on my serpentine belt. Replaced that. No labour charge. Excellent service. Would highly recommend this facility.,Positive
"So I've been coming to Mr.Lube for a quite awhile. With a number of different vehicles. There have been a number of small things that have bugged me about this place but today was the nail in the coffin. I took my work Van in to get an oil Change and once I handed in my keys went to the washroom when I came out the guy shows me some dirty pile of something I knew there was no way it could have come out of my Rear Diff and with absolute assurance tells me the guy under my Van says it's from my rear Diff. When I say ""You guys changed over my diff fluid last time"" He looks at the computer and sheepishly looks back at me and replys ""Oh? Yes so we did"" then proceeded to feed me a line about how he is going to talk to his manager and ""See what's up"" I never got to speak to said manager instead was fed some BS line about how he misunderstood what the guy under the van said. Think I'm just going to start doing my own oil changes again. On top of a broken Dipstick and an oil cap that didn't get put back on I've reached my limit with this company. If you are reading this don't trust a lube boy who shows you a dirty rag and says your rear diff fluid needs to be changed they should show you the actual plug. Anyway I Digress go here at your own risk.",Negative
Brutal. They don't stand behind their work. Got a light replaced and it burnt out in a week. Went back and they would not cover it... Took an hour too Last visit here,Negative
"Fast, friendly and professional. What more could you ask for? These guys were great. Will definitely go back. I even got $10 off for checking in there. Score!",Positive
"The best word I can think of is ""disappointed."" When I pulled in there was only 1 vehicle waiting, in line for Bay 1. I was flagged over to Bay 3 and offered the customary coffee/water and newspaper. So far so good.... I waited almost 20 minutes, lines were starting to form, and the F1-50 at Bay 1 was still waiting. Finally the woman running the lineups came over and started (with very poor communication skills) to explain that ""it's a first come first served basis,"" her first sentence. No ""hi"" or ""sorry"" or anything, cutting right to the grammatical nightmare of a point, ""and we need to get the F1-50 in first so we need you to switch lines, but it should only be 1-2 minutes difference."" Already I'm baffled because it will take at least 2 minutes to switch lines, so who is this helping? But I did as I was asked which, in that cramped space with other vehicles waiting, was a nightmare. We get to our new lines and I wait another 20-25 minutes (15 or so after the F1-50 pulled in. So much for that 2 minute difference) so that by the time I pulled in, he was already paying and getting ready to leave. When I got in it was MOSTLY clear sailing, except for an attendant with a VERY thick accent who was hard to understand over running engines and yelling, but when it came time for the up-sells they pointed out engine leaks I already knew I didn't have a number of little things I knew for a fact I could fix myself for free or close to (one was literally as simple as opening the hood and pressing a little plastic clip back into place). It really seemed like their whole game is to over-state problems to get you to pay for services that nobody with a screwdriver and access to Youtube should ever need to pay for. I used to get my oil changes done at Walmart for about 40 bucks, and for more or less the same package these guys charge 70, ON TOP of being abbrasive and condescending when you tell them that no, you don't need to pay them double retail price for a pair of wiper blades to avoid the 30 second chore of attaching them. The oil change itself was performed fairly quickly, once I got inside... but that's really the only thing I was satisfied with. I think I'll be looking for a different place to get my next oil change.",Negative
"Generally fast and efficient for being located right on McLeod Trail, though you'll likely have to wait if you're here at rush-hour, or on a Friday. Not all of the bays are open all of the time; however, I've generally had good luck with someone coming out and letting me know which lane to pull into. Staff are friendly and talk you though what they're doing and why. All the usual up-sells are there, but they don't seem to have the hard-push that some other places have. (and sometimes, they'll even acknowledge that yes, you can get a part for %50 less at the C-Tire down the road). I've really just gone here for regular oil changes, but did have them notice and then change a HIGHLY worn serpentine belt in my VW. While I'm sure I could have had it done cheaper elsewhere, it was nice that I could just get it done there, at the time, and the cost was well worth the convenience. PLUS... if you check in here with Yelp, you get $10 off! Solid.",Positive
"I really like this Mr.Lube. They clearly care about doing a good job and the upselling is minimal and seems to be for useful things. They refill everything possible, check filters and will lube up your doors. Great people great job.",Positive
"My experiences at ""quick lube"" places have been sketchy. My unfortunate visits have included parts being installed incorrectly (fuel filter dangling with no bracket); watching employees struggle with how to open my hood, or remove my air filter; watching them question the readings on the dipstick, and so on. It's apparent that at some chains, certain employees have pretty rudimentary training at best. So when the inevitable ""up sell"" comes (""Sir, would you like your X/Y/Z flushed?""), and my confidence in their abilities at zero, I've ONLY gone for the oil/filter change lately. Anything else is left for the dealership technicians. That being said, leaving my vehicle at a dealership for the day is hugely inconvenient, so quick lube spots have their place. Enter this Mr. Lube location: Driving home from work on Macleod during rush hour, I passed several quick lube spots that had cars lined up at the bays. Forging onwards, I found this location with zero lineup. In I pulled, and actually right into an empty bay. During rush hour? Score! It all went like clockwork. They were professional. They didn't do anything that made me wonder if they were installing something backwards. And they even asked for my keys when I shut off my truck (you just know someone in the past drove through a door by accident, or started their car sans oil, so they could listen to the radio). No complaints: best quick lube experience thus far.",Positive
Called Sarah to help with car seat installation. She was super knowledgable and came to our location same day to install our car seats. Highly recommend her services!! Thank you Sarah!,Positive
"Sarah Lee's presentation at the AARP CAR-EDU a free car care clinic was so enlightening. If you had your car for 10 yrs as I did, much has changed. All of the electronics in vehicles needs different care that most of us haven't a clue. She gave us information and a source for future guidance. The car buying experience has been most stressful but I will contact My CarLady for my next vehicle. Thank you, Sarah.",Positive
"This is the SECOND auto that I have purchased from FINDLAY... GR8 service and professionalism.... Sarah Marks worked her MAGIC again, and found the PERFECT car for me... I would recommend SARAH MARKS,, as she truly cares about her clients and listens to their specifications for a vehicle.... Thank you, Jan",Positive
"Sarah Lee, the best advocate you could hope for when buying a car, now offers a Smart Teen class. We just sent our son and stayed for the duration. Fantastic! Not only does she provide info about what to do in case of an accident and stuff like that, she takes the kids into the dealer garage and puts them under the hood. Checking oil, changing tires, jumping a battery -- the class covers it all. Anyone with a new driver should send them.",Positive
"She's friendly, helpful and always trustworthy! I've recommended her countless times. She'll help find you the perfect car, the perfect deal, and you'll leave with a friend in the car business. I contact her whenever there's a problem or just to tell her how much I love my car. she's the best!",Positive
"So 7 months later I go back to NTB to have 4 tires swapped from my current rims to new rims I just purchased. Sounds easy right? Well it took me almost 10 minutes to have the service writer understand what I wanted done. And when I called yesterday to make the appointment I asked what the wait time would be, they said 30-40 minutes. Get there today, drop off the car and ask what the wait time would be, 3-4 hours. There was 2 cars in the bays, and only my car in the parking lot...not sure how it will take that long. And the topper is the price difference...I was quoted $56.38 on the phone yesterday, and ended up paying over $120. Well I guess I am just going to keep going to White tire off of Lorain for all my tire and alignment needs.",Negative
"My fiancé just got her oil changed here. When she got home I checked the level and it was at the fill line on the dipstick. After taking the car back to be filled with the correct amount of oil, we were told they put the recommended 4.2 quarts in per their manual. I looked at the owners manual which stated 4.6 quarts. Either they are incompetent or just trying to scam you out of half a quart. They did fix their mistakes however we will not be going back.",Negative
"This is by far the worst NTB IN THE NTB franchise. I am done with this location and their hard sell tactics. I will tell you that there are other tire stores in neighborhood that will not hard sell you like this one will. I went in for two tires, they wanted to sell me 4 plus additional work and I walked out without any tires. I canceled my work order. Now they don't have my money, future business, future recommendations and I don't have 2 new tires. I am done with this lication. Good luck to you when you shop here.",Negative
"I purchased tires from a wholesaler and needed them installed on my car. Brought them into NTB at 11 am for an install. The new tires are in the back of my car. No big deal right : ) . 80 bucks for the installation when all said and done. A little pricey but whatever. Install might take longer than expected because I didn't have an appointment. Sure, fair enough. 4:50pm. I get a call from NTB letting me know my tires are installed and that I need an alignment on them as well. $170 for everything. Shoot, a lot more than what I figured but sure, go ahead. I make pretty good money. And THANK GOD a unicorn wasn't stuck in my muffler, THAT would have been expensive. 5:05pm. I get another call letting me know everything went according to plan. Cool! That alignment happened very fast, they probably didn't even do it. But hey! New tires on! Who can complain. Come on Cleveland snow, what you got? BUT, here comes the plot twist. I hope you are ready. Get a ride BACK to NTB to pick up my car. Walk up to my car.... Here's the kicker. PLOT TWIST! My car HADN'T BEEN MOVED! My old tires were STILL ON!! SAY WHAT!! Oh no you did'n! I go in and try to determine why I was going to be charged 170... I lost my cool a bit, rightfully so? Probably not. Then they try driving my car into the garage to install said tires. Poor car was just now given some attention. *Tear*. I demand they return my car and don't even bother with it; a bit aggressively I must admit. They also had the nerve to tell me they performed an alignment! Oh really? You guys probably filed my tax returns for 2014 too, right? All said and done, 6 hours of my life gone and 3 trips to NTB. Thanks NTB! Moral of the story, lease a car because... MECHANICS. : )",Negative
I've come here several times and the staff is very professional. They are honest as well and sincerely helpful. I told them what was wrong and what I was looking for and they had knowledgeable advise to guide me. All with no pressure.,Positive
"I went here in 2011 for an oil change because I often work late and they were open late. After the oil change, I left NTB and got on the highway going east. After five or ten minutes, I noticed smoke coming from under the hood. I pulled over on the highway and opened the hood, there was oil all over my engine compartment and the oil cap was missing from my car. I called NTB on my cell, and they admitted they forgot to put the oil cap back on. I drove my car slowly back to NTB where they topped off the oil and returned my oil cap to me, although my engine compartment was still covered in oil and smoking. After such a huge screw up, I expected them to offer me a free oil change at the very least. They did not offer me any compensation for their mistakes and my inconvenience. Suffice it to say, I never went back and I recommend you don't, either.",Negative
"I don't Yelp much anymore but felt I had to based on the great experience I had at this NTB (despite the poor reviews). We had a car that had been sitting in our garage for almost 2 years towed to this NTB for repair. They received the car in the morning and immediately called me with a plan. They called me before each step. The car miraculously started right up after a battery change. They could have up sold me spark plugs, a starter, alternator, etc but didn't. They left it at the battery. They even called later to ask if they could put $20 of gas in the car so we wouldn't be on empty when we picked it up. I will for sure return to this NTB for service. I'm glad that I had our car repaired here. They were polite, patient and courteous.",Positive
I took my car in for basic oil change and tire rotation. I had also noticed my tires were low from the low tire pressure sensor on my dashboard. I mentioned it to the man staffing the front desk and he said they'll take care of it no problem. When I returned to pick up my car I had a few concerns about the maintenance they did. We mentioned it to the man at the front desk and he immediately called someone to take it back and recheck my car. Everything was fine and the oil change/tire rotation/tire pressures were satisfactory. The man working at the front desk- I'm assuming he was the manager- said our maintenance this time was complimentary and that he wanted us to feel comfortable with NTB and trust their services. I was thoroughly impressed by their customer service and the work they did to my car. I wil definitely go back there in the future.,Positive
"I've used this particular NTB 3 times now. The first time, I had them install four new tires I purchased off tirerack.com (amazing site/service and a great way to save some cash, btw). Anyways, they did great with that install. The next two times I showed up for basic service, no one staffed the front desk. I waited around about 10 minutes before anyone came by to help me even schedule one of the appointments. On my third visit, I had a scheduled alignment. No one came to the front desk for 20 minutes and a mechanic rushed by--I tried to stop him but he kept walking. The two people waiting had been there for some time. I just left--it's not worth my time. I have an alignment warranty, so I needed to go to an NTB to take care of the car. I ended up going to the NTB near my work in Hudson, OH and it was a totally different experience. NTB Hudson was great--very clean, fast, friendly, and they actually had multiple people at the front desk. I also got a tire estimate for four new tires for my wife's car during my second trip to the Lakewood NTB. The estimate was pretty high, but I expect that from any NTB. What bothered me is that they had zero stock of a pretty common tire size. I got an estimate from the Hudson NTB, and the price for the same tires was almost $100 cheaper compared to Lakewood, without any discounts. They also had tires in stock for the car. I managed to get $100 off the cost and the overall price was heaper than tirerack.com, which was surprising. The Lakewood NTB is overcharging for some reason and it is poorly staffed. I don't think I'm going back at this point. Thankfully the Hudson location doesn't leave my warranty worthless.",Negative
"Really great to wash and detail ur car - great staff and great pricing, I love coming here to clean my car. Highly recommend, specially if u want great pricing. $30 tax included car wash, car detailing, tire shining and 3 additional car washes for future (gift card).",Positive
Not satisfied wid service they don't know how to treat with customer they are toooo rude i paid 30 dollars for wash and wait almost 30 min.,Negative
"Great value car wash, they always do a good job keeping my care nice and clean. Never a complaint. Free vacuums with car wash too.",Positive
"One star, but only because I can't leave zero and write a review. They only pre wash half the car, they always try to up sale but they do a terrible job so it is a complete waste of money. Only go here if your desperate and are ok with a half-assed wash.",Negative
First time going there and i didn't know how things ran around there. Workers talked shit about me and laughed in their language and i paid for the full detailing and they didn't even vacuum my trunk and the places the did vacuum they missed a lot of spots. Spend your money somewhere better. Very bad customer service the workers make you feel uncomfortable and feel stupid,Negative
"Zero stars really. Scam operation. Bought Groupon, called 5 times to make appt and never received a call back. Judging by other reviews it seems this is one of their tactics in ripping people off. I'm sure it would have cost me a lot more had I actually got any service from them. Good riddance",Negative
"Worst customer service ever! I thought this place was a joke. I purchased two groupons and made two appointments for Saturday morning. Our appointments were at 10 am. My fiance got there at 10 and I arrived about 10:02. There was one guy working and he was arguing with my fiance. He said I can't take your cars you're late. What do you mean late? He got there at 10 and I was 2 minutes late... wow. End of the world? He was so rude and refused to service us. Why? Oh probably because they has a third car arrive at 10 am to be serviced too. With only one person working. He even pointed to his ""policy"" and said see! If you're late we can refuse service. Meanwhile the third car arrived AFTER I did and he took her. This place is a joke, no wonder they have to sell groupons. I returned mine. Don't bother.",Negative
"DO NOT GO HERE!!! First of all they hit my car causing extensive damage and then denied that it was them. Second, I had bought a groupon deal for a detailing package and then they tried to charge me an extra $70 due to excessive stains (which was some light salt stains at the driver's floor mats).",Negative
"This place is running a rather suspicious operation. They have a Groupon for $50 which is supposed to include shampooing of the floor carpeting. However, if there are salt stains, then the surcharge is $80 (all vehicles will have salt stains either during or after winter, and this is why someone would naturally purchase a package that includes shampooing)! They will not honour the service purchased through Groupon UNLESS you're willing to pay the extra $80. My experience was as follows: 1. Show up at appointment time 2. Staff arrives at the shop 3. Fill out an intake form, where I must write the Groupon voucher # 4. One of them looks at my car and tells me that my package isn't sufficient so I should call Groupon for a refund 5. After I ask how much extra it would cost for them to do the work (since I wasted my time going there after all) they mentioned $80 6. I ask if I can call Groupon to make sure it's refundable before leaving. However, they tell me I cannot stay in the shop because they have other things to do 7. They hurriedly leave the shop and lock everything up, literally 15 minutes into my appointment time 8. I call Groupon for the refund, only to find out they used the information on the form I filled out earlier to redeem the coupon without having offered any service! The whole thing happened so quickly and fluidly that it truly appeared as though the staff never had any intention of detailing the vehicle. Everything seemed to go like clockwork in terms of denying service but not before stealing the fee paid for the Groupon! Fortunately, after explaining the whole thing to Groupon customer service, I did get a refund, but that was at Groupon's expense and meanwhile I wasted time and gas going all the way to their shop for nothing.",Negative
"Are these guys serious?? The customer service is awful. I called to make an appointment SIX TIMES and was given the runaround from everything from ""I can't hear you, call back..."" to ""I'm going to put you on hold..."" where I waited twice for over 10 mins. I called back yet again and was told I couldn't make an appointment and when I asked why not, I was told there was no reason and was hung up on. Unfreakingbelievable!!l If this is how they deal with potential customers, I don't want them touching my vehicle...",Negative
"Bad part is that is took 4 hours to detail a small SUV, but the good part is that when we got our car is was shining and the interior was spotless. Had purchased a groupon and after reading the reviews I did my best to roll with whatever came my way. Brought my computer, had a movie I wanted to watch on Netflix, wore comfy clothes, scoped out a nearby McDonald's - it was fine. I went into knowing that I was going to wait, but I was expecting a good thorough detail. In the end, I really appreciated the time and care they took, it was one of the better details I've had, and for the price (Groupon + tax + overage for having an SUV) it was great. If you go be sure to plan for the timing and they don't accept Visa only debit, and the machine doesn't have an option to tip - so bring some cash. And they are busy, so you can't be late... there's always another car looking to take your spot.",Positive
"it was my first time getting detailed and i used a living social deal. they have a nice little front lounge and staff were really nice. they let me get detailed even though i was late. i was disappointed that it was much more expensive than i thought it was going to be. I got the promotional package. They didn't really clean my trunk and it cost me an extra $40 to get a stain removed, despite the fact that the shampoo of the seats was supposed to be included. I'd probably go back though bc they were super nice and my car smells great. I would just ask for details before you buy any deals.",Positive
"My mother in laws car wasn't starting and I needed to take it someplace. Found Oren off of yelp. I wasn't disappointed. I thought it was the starter, it wasn't. Long story short, the problem with the car ended up being pretty complicated, Oren kept me updated the whole way. Oren is a straight forward and honest small business owner who takes the time to explain things and physically showed me when I got there. He could have overcharged me. But like I said he is a trustworthy mechanic.",Positive
Anytime anything has happened to my vehicles I take it to Oren's. he is fast professional and diagnosis any problem with ease. He is the most honest shop I've found in town and have never had any issues with work that is preformed. I just can't say enough about how great this shop is. I will never go to anyone else.,Positive
Brought my car in. Oren wanted to work on other things besides what was wrong with the car to get the most money out of me. Good thing this place is closed & shut down!,Negative
"Oren's Auto Repair is the only place I will take my car for repairs. The service is always personal and professional. Oren explains the problem, the proposed repair, and the cost in a manner I can understand. He always makes sure any questions are answered before asking for my approval to do the work. He stands behind his warranty and will do everything he can to make sure I am completely satisfied with the work his mechanical staff performs on my vehicle. I highly recommend this shop to anyone who needs repairs performed on their car.",Positive
"I found myself with an overheated car late on a Sunday night so instead of driving back to L.A. I had to spent the night researching Vegas mechanics and decided on contacting Oren the next morning to check out my car. When I called the shop Oren picked up the phone and he was extremely friendly and personable. When I got my car to his shop Oren himself greeted me in the parking lot and his team began checking out my car immediately. I was extremely happy with Oren and his team and if I ever have car troubles in Vegas again I will be contacting him, no doubt. FYI...The address showing on yelp off Rainbow is outdated. His shop is now located (@4375 Reno) in a business center off Arville near Tropicana. You can see the Orleans casino when you are in the parking lot of his shop.",Positive
Sweet these guys are so awesome get the job done thank you they diagnosed very well they are better than any shop in town,Positive
Awesome shop but I went there today and they are sold.. The shop next door doesn't have good rate.. any recommendation ?,Positive
"Brought in my 2011 BMW 328i into Lee to get some warranty work done. Car was stalling when trying to start on cold mornings, and had a very rough idle - so things were a little scary. Lee is very honest, was able to diagnose the issue very quickly and explained in layman's terms exactly what needed to be done. I also had my brakes and oil done at the same time and his pricing to have this done was very, very good and competitive. I was able to pick up my car the next day - car washed and running better than ever. Thanks for the great service!",Positive
"Lee is an honest and great mechanic! He fixed our BMW and did a fantastic job! He is very honest, informative, knowledgeable, good about following up with updates on the status of the repair and very professional. We feel extremely comfortable leaving our car is his hands. It is so rare to find someone like Lee. We wouldn't take our car anywhere else. Thank you for all your help and professionalism. You have guaranteed a forever customer. Thanks again for everything!",Positive
"How often do you hear a mechanic say ""What are they talking about? It doesn't need replacement. It's still a good working part!"" Now that's Passion! It's absolutely a keeper! The most honest car repair shop I've ever encountered in the valley. You will never look for another shop once you experience their service. Lee, is just an awesome guy with lots of energy and great customer approach. Beemer issues, bring it to Passion.",Positive
"Great prices, great service, good guy. I needed rear brakes for my BMW 328i convertible. Checked around and gave this place a try. Glad I did. Lee is an honest guy and great with customer relations. Actually asked me to observe him measuring my rear rotors. He said they were ok and could have said they needed replacement. Appreciated his approach and honesty. Offered me a ride both ways ( I declined) and washed and vacuumed my ride. Clean shop, fair prices, good location and delivered on time with zero issues. Bye bye dealer, hello Passion.",Positive
"I was just about to take my BMW 328i to the BMW dealer on Sahara to for an overdue oil change when, for the first time in a long time, I was glad to find a flyer on my car that I wouldn't throw away. The dealer had quoted me significantly more for an oil change and told me to go rent a car in the meantime! Not good customer service at all. Now I knew about Passion Auto Repair, so I went there instead. The oil change was quick, easy and less expensive than the dealership. A few days later a belt broke and couldn't drive my car. First thing I did was call Lee, the owner of Passion Auto Repair, and he helped me right away by not only recommending a good towing company, but he also waited past closing hours until my car got there by way of tow truck. Lee then fixed the belt and oil leak the next morning. In addition, he power washed the entire car. Lee educated me and sent me photos of the progress throughout this. He is honest, he knows what he is doing when it comes to BMWs and does not try to up-sell or overcharge. Ladies, for all of you who have felt taken advantage of at the dealership, you must go here instead! An honest, family-owned business, a gem in my book!",Positive
This place is awesome i went in with my 535i got some services done the boys there are very honest the prices was excelent and on top of that they detailed my car and delivered to my job. A refreshing change from what im used to.,Positive
"My dad took his car there a couple of years ago for manifold work. Everything seemed great until he got home. He tried to start his car and something didn't sound right. Turns out that a transmission linkage was left disconnected. If my dad had put his car in gear, the car would have spun out of control. When my dad called to let Paul, the owner, know, Paul cussed my dad out. If you want to be ridiculed by the owner and have him take no responsibility for his employees actions, then this is the place to go.",Negative
"I have been dealing with Paul's Arizona Auto since 1996. I started with taking my Railroad Vehicles to them and taking my personal Vehicles to them. Paul and Mike are the best people I have ever dealt with both for my business Vehicles as well as my personal Vehicles. I now am a General Sales Manager at a Used Car Dealership and was going to send a car to them to work on. Paul calls me back and says ""Hey there's a recall on that, it's covered"" BEFORE I even took it in. He was RIGHT and we had the repair fixed for free by the manufacturer, now mind you he could have fixed it and charged us. He didn't even let me take the vehicle to him nor did he charge me for his time he took to find out what we needed to do. Long story short they are and have been THE BEST MECHANIC SHOP I HAVE EVER DELT WITH!!! Honest and straightforward!!! Hard to find these days right? Nope it's RIGHT THERE!",Positive
Took girlfriend car in not running right Pauls said it was the fuel pump So we had it replaced Still not running right Called left message No return call Girlfriend called left message No return call Thanks Paul Don't go here !,Negative
"If you don't know how to do car repairs yourself and you are like me, right after your healthcare provider, a car mechanic comes next. Awhile back I was stuck when the mechanic I was going to and loved, decided to move on to other things. Then I found Paul's AZ Auto Service on Yelp and they had all the credentials a good auto repair shop strives for and ratings that told me I could trust. Sure enough, Paul has made me feel completely confident that I can count on him like all the other customers before me that have made him and his son their mechanic for the last 40 years. It comes down to the honesty they show when it comes to checking out what I think might be a problem and reassuring me if it isn't. In the event of a problem, they give me options, such as price quotes and time to think through what I will do. They are the only place where I get my oil changed every three thousand miles because I like that they don't just change the oil. They look the car over and fill all the fluids at the same time. A great thing if you are embarking on a road trip and especially now that gas stations don't offer full service like they used to. A no pressure, service oriented business, it is the kind of place where buddies just stop in and gather for donuts early in the morning. Kinda like the old TV show, Cheers, where everybody knows your name. https://youtu.be/909_zHxZVMo",Positive
"I first discovered this shop when my wife was working at the school across the street from it. She said that she had heard good things and, since we were new to the area, started going there for our service and repair needs. Like others have stated, Paul, Mike and the rest of the crew are PAINFULLY honest and forthright; they won't go into any repair unless they explain what needs to be done, in detail, and if the repairs are worth it compared to the value of the vehicle. An example of their honesty: I thought that the neutral safety switch on my 2001 Jeep Wrangler was bad so I bought the part and went to Paul's to have it installed. A few hours later Paul called and said the issue was fixed and that it was nothing more than a dirty connection, which was cleaned and solved the problem. He gave the part back to me to return for a refund when he could have kept it and charged me for installation. My wife has also take her car in a couple of time for minor repairs and they were done FOR NO CHARGE!!! Where else can you get this kind of treatment? Paul's shop is so honest, reliable and reasonable in their charges that I usually just drop off my vehicles and tell them to fix any issues that they discover, knowing full well that they will never jack me around. The only issue that I have is that they are not open on the weekend or holidays, in order to give the crew time off and family time, haha! But, that's the kind of family oriented business that I want to deal with. I cannot recommend this shop highly enough and you'll be extremely pleased if you go there!!",Positive
"Paul is awesome, if your car is not worth fixing, he will tell you and you wont waste money on a bottomless pit of car work. He has always been honest. They do great work and give you the lowest price they possibly can. Fixed my oil leak for much less than the dealership quoted me, I would never go anywhere else!!",Positive
"I have visited Paul's on multiple occasions and I am surprised that I haven't written a review yet! They have provided excellent service on all of my visits and have been welcoming. Paul's Arizona Auto Service has replaced my shocks and struts, done wiring for my headlights, and multiple repairs. Each time I go I am treated with respect and offered great prices. I always do my research on repairs, and I have always been given excellent deals here. I also appreciate that if I stay for my repair, Paul includes me in on conversation. It is like hanging out in my grandpa's garage. I feel welcomed and appreciated.",Positive
"Do not take your car here. We spent over $3,000 on a new engine! Should have been like new! Broke again and Paul (the owner) blamed my daughter. We paid more money for their shoddy work!!! Do not give your business to this garage!!!",Negative
"I had an amazing experience with Paul's Auto. They were able to give me an estimate on my repairs over the phone and I was surprised it was considerably lower than another national chain that I always bring my vehicle to. I was also pleased one of the shop guys (Mike) was able to run me home and pick me up the next day. What service! Also when I did return for my vehicle, I was informed two of the repairs recommended by the other national chain were not even necessary at all. Thank you for being honest and saving my hard earned dollars! I will definitely be returning for all of my car maintenance needs.",Positive
"This place is amazing! My daughter moved to AZ to attend professional school, knowing nobody let alone someone to fix her car. She had an issue with her hatchback and someone local recommended Paul's. Paul and others in the shop treated her so well and fixed her problem within minutes. They welcomed her to the area and even went a step further and gave her emergency numbers to call in case her car breaks down! I highly recommend Paul's!",Positive
"So I KNEW it was a matter of time before I had to suck it up and get my A/C fixed now that I live in Arizona, at 110 degree the putting it off period was coming to an end. After making 6, I kid you not SIX calls to local auto repair places I was disheartened. Not only was I looking at an average of $75-$100 quotes just to check my car out, not even hook it up to the diagnosis machine, I was ready to cry when they all said most likely it was my A/C compressor and that would run $400 at the very least to fix. I called Reilly's American Auto, I was ready to call the search off for the day and become a hermit. The man who answered was polite and knowledgeable. He listened to my car issues and told me to come in whenever it worked for be before 5 pm. I asked how much I was looking to have to cough up to get a diagnosis and he said ""Nothing, we do that for pretty much nothing! After taking a second to double check I hadn't heard that wrong and told him I'd be in the next day. I figured this would be like all mechanics, you know what I mean, when a few minutes means hours. I went over today and they reviewed my car issues (wait, what?! he actually LISTENED? NO WAY!!) Paul called a guy in to take my car around, stressing that it has an auto locking system so they guys would take care not to lock my keys in(ANOTHER SHOCK!). In under an hour they gave me back my keys and said I was ready to go(calling me Miss no less *swoon* as 30 approaches that gets brownie points!). I walked over to the counter to find out how much it would cost and they told me it was FREE! They cleaned my air intake and I was golden! I stood there waiting for the usual list of costly ""Must have or you will crash and die"" repairs and was told I should put some work into my car but nothing life or death and to have a great day!! Long story short, I LOVE this place! They were friendly but not creepy, knowledgeable but use that knowledge for good and not evil price gouging and handing out needless service to do lists. Their prices are fair from the price estimates he gave me for the ""down the road work"". They are officially MY new mechanics!",Positive
"Stewart & Andrew Took care of my Mercedes S-Class with First-Class Service. I would Highly Recommend Pep Boys Services for Tire, Brake or Any Other Auto Repair.",Positive
https://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/pep_boys.htm. Read the reviews that they have and you can decide weather you want to go back there again,Negative
I made an appointment for 1pm to get a flat repaired and the tires rotated. 6 hours later car is still not ready must say I am disappointed.,Negative
I've had a lot of work done on my vehicle at this location. Alex who works at the service area desk is extremely helpful and knowledgeable about any issues I've had. If you're needing repairs on your car then this is the Pep Boys you should go to. It seems a little more expensive than other service/mechanic shops but it's well worth it. I will definitely continue to keep bringing my car here for maintenance and repairs.,Positive
"I was leaving town and knew if I didn't get my battery checked and replaced, that it would die while I was out of town. Alex helped me out, not only was she helpful and friendly with me, she was also dealing with being the cashier, coordinating things with the mechanics, answering an endlessly ringing phone, and helping multiple customers. The gentlemen who tested my battery out was friendly and informative. He was also the bearer of the bad news. Not only did I need a new battery but also a new cable. (They were super crusty...I'm actually surprised the car was starting at all in the first place.) The team at pep boys got it done quickly and painlessly. I'll definitely be back again. I hate car stuff, but feel great about the service I receive there.",Positive
"I had made an appointment on line, which I found out tends to overbook. I appreciate that Stu was honest and let me know up front they were running a bit behind. Because he was honest about the time schedule,I was able to occupy my time at the shopping center near by instead of waiting in the store.",Positive
"Made an appointment for 10 am to replace a tire pressure sensor was told 1 to 1 1/2 hours, dropped the car off at 10:03 am went and got breakfast, came back at 11:15 am car was still sitting, asked for my keys they gave them back without an apology or any word at all. Will not set foot here again no customer service, simply relying on pep boys name",Negative
"By far the worst service I've had when dealing with my car. All I wanted was lightbulbs for my headlights and the guy tried to charge me $115.00. When I asked why it was so expensive for light bulbs, his answer was that he was charging me for labor. I'm sorry but I wasn't aware how laborious it is to screw in a light bulb. Definitely will never return here as it's clear they just want your money for very simple tasks.",Negative
"Went here to get a diagnostic done on my car, Omar was very helpful. He kept me informed on when my car would be ready and explained what problems that were shown on the computer. All the whole staff was friendly and answered any question I had.",Positive
"Dropped my car off for and oil change and showed back up 2 hrs later and the cars hadn't even moved. They acted like they fell into some sort of twilight zone and no one knew they work suppose to be worked on. Had to wait another hr for my car. They gave me a free oil change, but didn't rotate my tires like I asked either. Not going back even for a free oil change.",Negative
"I got a flat today, and had to get that tire, plus my spare replaced. Such a bummer! But the customer service here was awesome...especially the girl at the front desk and the guy who did my tires! Everyone was super friendly and did a good job.",Positive
"I have been going to this location since 2008. From car batteries to the fuel pump replacement and everything in between on most of the cars that my family owns, they have always done a great job. The staff is professional and very good at breaking down the whole process of what they plan to do. Nothing is done without agreement from the customer. I will definitely keep coming here.",Positive
"This is the second time (against my better judgment) that I had my Dodge Charger serviced here. Both times I made an appointment on line the day before. I got up early both times to make my appointment on time and both times I was the second person in line and had to wait entirely TOO LONG to be helped. The people who work behind the counter see me standing there, but continue their slow pace. Yesterday I had Omar help me and he seemed bored to death and bothered that I was there. I told him I needed my brakes checked. He called me approximately 2 hours later and advised me it would be close to $1,000 for brakes, rotars and service!! Outrageous I said! I'm not prepared to pay that today!! I ended up getting the front brakes done and an oil change for $602! When I went to pick up my car - same slow service!!! Last time they see me coming!!!!",Positive
"I liked the set of hankook tires I bought for my toyo highlander I especially like their warranty Ongoing in for a flat repair,a small staple caused a slow leak,I was told they would not repair it.The 2 prongs of staple were too close to plug.PLUGS! PLUGS!? WE DONT NEED NO STINKING PLUGS! I explained plugs were a cheap and unacceptable repair,especially under warranty.Their next best and unacceptable fix cost $57 out of my pocket.What good is their warranty? You figure.$32 down the street got fix from real tire men patched and balanced. .Oh,by the way,staple only made 1 hole.Tire man showed me that. North rancho store John",Negative
"Being a military wife, I have been all over the United States. I have always used pep boys. When I came to this store for the first time there was a little problem that made me unsatisfied. I spoked to Brandon on the phone about the issues. He understood my concerns. I came back today to fix the situation. Brandon was awsome. He listen to my concerns, we talked to the technician. Brandon was instrumental in satisfying all of our needs. I was so satisfied, I ended up getting 4 tires while I was here. Thank you to the staff and a very big thank you to Brandon. Make that 5 tires. Haha. My spare was bad. Thank you again to Brandon and his staff.",Positive
"I was always quick to go to an alley mechanic because they were cheap but that's when i lived in Chicago. Now i stay here in Vegas and i couldnt trust just anyone so i tried Pep Boys. My first experience with them was the best! The didnt over charge me and they didnt make me feel like they were trying to find every little thing wrong with my car just so they could get paid. I joined their rewards program and evrything got better from there! I love this love this location in lake mead because they're pretty quick, very friendly, and they know me by name! They supervisor here is Brandon and he is sooooo helpful! Every time I get serviced here, he makes sure I'm comfortable with what we're going to do with my car and he even gives me a few tips on how to maintain my car after leaving their garage! Pep Boys are awesome but lake mead and tenaya location is the best one to me! If u dont want to feel like ur being robbed and u want great and the best service to ur car, go here and ask for Brandon! Tell them Nikita sent u!",Positive
"I can not say enough about how this team pulled together to help me out in my time of need. Brandon, Alex and Wayne went above and beyond and made and bad situation a great experience. All I can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your work ethic, attitude and compassion rocks!",Positive
"I made an appointment online for 5pm to have an oil leak checked on a VW Jetta. I was early and arrived at 4:30. The gentleman and lady behind the counter were very nice, but the reason I'm only giving 2 stars is because I was told they probably don't have the tools to fix the leak and there was no technician to look at it. They lost 3 stars for the sheer fact their online scheduling system sucks. I never would've wasted my time. And if they don't have to tools to fix the problem, why would it allow me to select that option when scheduling. Dumb.",Negative
"I had a coupon for $25 oil change, but since the coupon was on my phone, they argued they wouldn't honor it electronically. It was not from some coupon site. It was from Pep Boys own site with a bar code. The manager or acting manager finally accepted it after a lot of discussion. The oil change didn't include even checking fluid levels. Now this was about 2 years ago but still ïrratates me and I will not buy anything there even a aroma hanging tree. I previously thought they were a decent place for parts and repair.",Negative
"One of the best tire buying experiences I've ever had. The whole staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and gave me a great deal on tires, alignments, and more for both of my vehicles. Big shout out to Brian, who showed exceptional customer service skills. You guys made me a repeat customer going forward and I will definitely recommend this location anyone I know that needs tires.",Positive
Awesome service! Both of our vehicles have had oil changes done here. Mine needed some maintenance in addition to the oil change and the service manager helped me prioritize what needed done ASAP and what could wait until the next visit. Definitely recommend!,Positive
"I guess I should have read the reviews here first. I will say that my car was repaired properly. The tech Ron who worked on the car was all smiles and pleasant to talk with. BIG WORD OF CAUTION THOUGH! The upsell techniques they use are dishonest by current automotive standards and yes, I am an expert in this area. 1) Get your estimate in writing, or email or text with complete detail. Do not approve anything verbally. 2) Make sure they print your repair order and you look it over BEFORE you pay. In my experience ""the speed of the captain is the speed of the ship"" so shame on the store manager. The service manager Jay, should NEVER be talking to customers - ever!!!!",Negative
"Jay, Omar and Omar worked to find a pin hole in my tire. They state almost an hour after closing to make sure that my car was ok or my wife to drive. I appreciate the true professionalism that they have here and I will be back. Trust and business is earned, they earned all of my business! Thank you!",Positive
"the associate Chris and the Manager Dan where very helpful. Chris is always willing to help me and is very knowledgeable, he knows alot about the products they sell and more. every time i have a question Chris is able to answer it and explain it I explained my situation with Chris and Dan and they took care of me. I shook there hands and thanked them. Thank you Chris and Dan and thank you pepboys for hiring such good employees. Steve",Positive
"Truck was on its last leg due to vandalism did not have a clue what to do apart from pay to have it fixed. Jay really took care of us in a time of need and we could not ask for better service or and better additive. The managers here have a ""Pay it Forward"" outlook on their business and it shows. I will be going back if i need anything for our truck. A nation wide brand with the community in mind Everyday .. A+",Positive
"My car battery died--again. I'm sure I just got a new one last year, but with this killer desert heat, it's not a surprise that I had to replace it so soon. When I had an inkling that my battery was approaching its demise, I made an appointment online for the next day's first available time, which was 8:00am on a Wednesday. Wednesday morning comes along and I can't start my car to get there on time, of course. After getting a jump from my knight in Under Armour, we arrive half an hour later. Long story longer, they saw me around 9:00am and said it would take about 20 minutes to change out the battery. 20 minutes really means an hour in Pep Boys lingo. I was out of there around 10:05am. I'm just grateful that it wasn't something more expensive like the alternator. Recommendation to Manny, Moe, and Jack: make your waiting area more friendly to customers and offer a Sparkletts water station and a TV, especially with this heat and if we have to sit around for more than an hour. This time I got a battery with an extended warranty so maybe I won't be back until 2015.",Positive
"The worst!! I had an appointment for an oil change. Arrived an hour early because I was in the neighborhood. I was told the wait would be 90 minutes. When I asked if I should just come back in an hour, the clerk told me that I'd still have to wait. Alright, no biggie, I had a book and time to kill for a bit so I waited. Two hours later, I walk out back and see that my car has yet to be serviced. Upon asking the new desk clerk, it is discovered that my ticket got ""skipped""!!!! Are you kidding me?? The mechanic grabs the ticket and I'm told he will begin it ""right now"". Approximately 45 minutes later, I tell them that I'm sick of waiting and that they can just give me my keys and I'll go somewhere else. ""Oh its done, let me just get your ticket printed and ring you up"". ? Do I have to ask you to both ""start"" and ""finish"" my transaction?? If I would have asked 30 minutes prior to that, would she have realized it was done and sent me on my way. On top of that, there is only one restroom for women, and one for men. I discover the ladies stall is broken and toliet does not flush. Well, their are ladies working here, so in my min, maybe there is another restroom for us to use. Im then told that I can go across the street to Denny's and use there's...or the mens room. WHAT!!!!! I'm a paying customer that has been waiting for 2 hours, and you send me across the street? Not even an apology for the inconvenience? Nothing from these dunces. Not once. No apology for forgetting my ticket. No apology for not having adequate restroom facilities for people waiting for hours on paid services. No apology for rude service men who act as though you are asking too much to take a pee in a clean, bug free, working facility. I will NEVER go back! Usually I reserve myself from complain about bad service or places I don't like, but this place takes the cake. It is now a personal strike I'm forging against Pep Boys.",Negative
$20 evaluation. A few months back I came in to get my tires balanced. Guy behind the desk convinces me that for $20 they will give my car a complete examination and tell me every thing I need done. This is just a device for them to sell you a jacked up package of crap. They wanted to sell me new tires and all sorts of under carriage repairs. I think it was over $2000 of recommended repairs. This is a scam operation. Stay away.,Negative
"Over the last 5 to 8 months, I have visited this location to purchase different parts for my cars. Each time I visit, the employees have been very helpful and infomative. I also find that their prices are fair with a large variety to choose from. Yesterday I took my car into to have it worked on and I found that their service department was equally as nice. Thank you for the great customer service.",Positive
"After my last experience at Pep Boys, where the jerks made me wait forever before I got fed up and left, I was hesitant to come back in. But, man, I can't live with busted car. So, off I went into Pep Boys to see what they can do for me. The service here is, without a doubt, the best ever. Seriously. I could not imagine better customer service short of them giving me free stuff. It was great. I walked in, approached a guy working there, and asked him if they could test my battery for me. Sure, he said, just park up by the first bay. By the time I walked back out and pulled my truck in, they were waiting for me. They tested my vehicle, ensured my battery was dead, and quickly set me up with a new one. Total time spent from when I walked in to when I got back outside: 15 minutes. Seriously, it was the best. I spent the 15 minutes there walking around and looking at cool things for my truck, and I was approached by a few people asking me if I needed anything. No, but thank you for asking. All in all, I walked away super happy from there. I couldn't have asked for better service, and I will no longer go to any other Pep Boys but this one.",Positive

The owner came and took care of it immediately and it only took about 15 minutes. Did the job for VERY reasonable price. I'll will be bringing my vehicle back here again for sure next time it needs repair. Fantastic customer service!",Positive
"I have been bringing my vehicles to another local mechanic for a few years. The last two experiences have been bad enough to send me out looking for another mechanic. I decided to try Precision Imports today for an oil change and I am so glad I did. Al was extremely helpful, got me in right away, and I was out of there in less than 30 minutes. I will be going back here for vehicle maintenance and repair from now on. Thanks so much!!",Positive
"Excellent experience! Al and his guys did a great job with my Honda CRV. Very straight up and honest, got me right in and out in 3 hours Dealers quote was $300 hundred more and 4-5 hours long. I'll definitely be back to Precision Imports. Thanks guys",Positive
"Well I always will comment on good experiences always, and man on man after 7 times at the Airpark jeep dealer since dec 22nd after a ""factor recall"" issue and ""ac issue "" and 4500$ later my jeep still wouldn't start and no ac and yet the dealer at Airpark recommended another ""1800"" job to fix what was found to be a ""simple starter "" issue . Yes the ""buyer beware "" is upon us the consumers to research which is insane if we go to a professional and pay full price for work to fix the issue not ""bandage it"" This company is fantastic no monkeying around no bullshit and wow my jeep was done in ONED DAY and was not even HALF of what the ""dealer "" said I ""needed "" unbelievable that most consumers aren't ""aware "" and thank god for this referral and the facts I actually know all about jeeps as this is my 5th one for that reason so I can be ""awear"" .. THANK YOU THANK YOU AL and your amazing staff honestly professional and fixing the PROBLEM not ""assuming "" I am so greatfull for this place!!!! Humbly HairDoc TK",Positive
"These guys are the best!!!!! Very fair priced and do amazing work!!! They keep my Acura in tip top shape and it has over $200,000 miles on it!!!! Couldn't ask for a more trustworthy group of guys!!",Positive
"These guys are so helpful and kind. They will never rip you off. I went in to change a headlight and one of the owners recognized that my ABS sensor had started to fail (this is common in prius'). Since he owns a (gen 1) prius himself, he was familiar with the problem. I had gone to the dealership previously and they quoted something like $3000 to fix the sensor. At Precision Imports they found me a slightly used sensor and installed it, all for $800. I appreciated that he fixed my headlamp and helped me to fix another issue that I hadn't even asked about, all while saving me some cash. This place is crazy busy though, it's always hard to find a parking spot, but you know that business is good if the lot is full.",Positive
"I miss this place so much. I remember the quality of service and professional service at its best. If ever there was a successful shop due to its service and people skills, this would be it! I know how they treat people and use to take photos of parking lot-always full for service then the next day or two, a new set of cars. This place has a great reputation and I've recommended them to many. I think they need a bigger place because their reputation exceeds them and growth had them hiring mechanics. I miss living around the corner but have the best memories of satisfaction. I will be back when they expand as I'm sure they will. Honest mechanics are hard to find.",Positive
"Everyone wants an honest auto shop, and I may have found the place. I've taken two different cars to Precision Imports on two occasions and each time, I've been pleasantly surprised by their no-nonsense and efficient approach. Both times I dropped off my car, I received a call within 60 minutes explaining the issue, the needed repair, and the cost. That's it! No trying to talk me into services/repairs that I don't really need. I've braced myself for the up-sell, but it's never occurred. Me: ""So that's it? Just an oil change? Nothing else needs to be fixed?"" Al: ""You sound disappointed."" No disappointment! Just happy that maybe, just maybe, I've stumbled upon one of the good ones. Actually - not a stumble. I have to give my sister credit for this one. Thanks Sara!",Positive
"If you are looking for trustworthy and affordable mechanics come to Precision Auto Imports. My whole family takes our cars here and we are always impressed with their services. Unexpected car repairs can be expensive but these guys will go out of their way to get your parts at the best price. They also prioritize what repairs are most essential to your car running well so you're not spending all your money at once. As a female, it can sometimes be intimidating when taking your car somewhere for repairs. The employees here are so kind, patient, and really work with you to explain what your options are. Thank you Precision Auto, you guys are second to none!!",Positive
"I have taken my car here for years. They might be a little more expensive than everyone else around them but they are always worth it. Al and Frank are trustworthy and honest. They do things right the first time, and if they do mess up they do their best to make it right.",Positive
A friend recommended them. Frank and crew were very helpful and reasonably priced. Would recommend them to anyone who wants good honest service.,Positive
"I've been going to Precision Imports for almost 20 yrs. Frank & Al are the most trust-worthy guys in the business. Even though I just relocated to the Far East valley (Gilbert), I still take my car to them and rent a vehicle while my car is being serviced. Plain & simple: quality service at an extremely fair price!",Positive
Everyone knows how difficult it is to find a trustworthy mechanic. I just had my 2010 Camry serviced today at Precision Imports and I will definitely return. I paid about half of what the dealer quoted and most importantly I trust the honesty and expertise from Precision. They serviced the transmission and radiator using OEM fluids and did the job right. These guys are true professionals and were very committed to pleasing this customer. Thanks!!,Positive
"What repair shop doesn't charge you when nothing is wrong? THIS ONE!! I've taken my BMW in twice for different weird alerts showed up. The first time they charged me a fraction of what the guys across the street would have (I know this because I used to go there). The second time I called to see how late they'd be open, they called me by my name (from the caller ID) - love that. They couldn't find anything wrong, after lifting it. And NO CHARGE. I will be back!!",Positive
"My family has been going here for a long time, but until recently I insisted on using my own mechanic. When he moved away I began going here. Here were the three situations. 1. My battery went out and my Acura stereo wouldn't start without a code. I took the car to them and one of them ran out, popped the hood, jumped into the car, did some special trick, turned on the radio, jumped out and said, ""There you go, don't worry about it."" THEY DIDN""T CHARGE ME!!!!!!!! 2. My wife was driving our car on the south side and blew a flat. Her dad changed the tire and shore off two of the posts. I had it towed to Precision with the new posts in hand. They fixed it that day and only charged me $40! 3. I had a crack in my radiator and a couple of hoses. I figured it would be very expensive. I took it over there and they had it replaced in the same day for $340. They are honest and efficient. They do not overcharge. Many other people know this so they are always doing a LOT of business. They are THE best in the Central Phoenix corridor.",Positive
"I had gotten my AC compressor replaced at Precision last year, 2012. They were very quick and friendly, and were quite good about making a note of all of the expenses included in the repair. Fast forward a year later, that compressor broke. I brought my car back, and they replaced it within a day. The guy behind the counter was super nice, and the transaction was fuss-free and quick. I'd bring my car back again if I had any issues. But hopefully I don't have to :)",Positive
"I believe I first stumbled into this place in 2001 or so. Had a Honda. These guys in their little greasy office were my new best friends! Honest, straight forward, no-nonsense, I'm running out of adjectives. They told me what I needed, how much it cost and when it would be ready. I picked up my car when they said and that was that. Sometimes they gave extra analysis. Time passed and I moved away for 6 years. I went back to them about a year ago with a mini cooper - they remembered me and wondered why I wasn't driving a Honda or Toyota :-). They honestly told me that they could not fix the issue I had (they did not have the high-tech Mini/BMW equipment required), so Mini fixed it for $1,700. I went back with a Toyota Rav4 - their specialty. Easy in and out for scheduled maintenance and always less than $40. Today, they did maintenance. Friendly service, easy for me in and out. Frank told me that the Right Rear shock was leaking and since it was under warranty I should take it to Toyota. I did, they fixed it free of charge (I know, few things in life are REALLY free - especially at the Toyota Dealership). My point is that Frank told me the up-front truth about my car and didn't try to sell me anything. He could have ignored it but that's not how he/they operate. Which is why he and Al are so well regarded and so appreciated on sites like this. It's also why you don't see their name on billboards, or bus benches, or mailers in your mailbox. No need. Their reputation supplies them with all the business they can handle. And they handle a LOT of business.",Positive
"Awesome customer service. Honest, trustworthy repair work. Frank was very honest with me about what needed to be done and the most reasonable fee available. Thank you so very much! Shannon",Positive
"They are the best. I refer people to them all the time. My dad uses them, too. Great honest guys. The only bad thing is maneuvering their tight parking lot. You want an honest mechanic? It's these guys. Ask for Al or Frank!",Positive
If your looking for a import mechanic in central phoenix talk to Frank. He will always tell you how it is and give you a fair price and they will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside after leaving. You can't say that about any other mechanic in the valley. Thanks again guys! -Tony,Positive
"I first discovered these grease monkeys on Car Talk's website when I wanted to take my Toyota Highlander in for service at a place other than the Toyota dealership. Precision Imports had rave reviews on both Yelp and Car Talk's websites, so I figured I could trust them. I have gone in twice and both times they were extremely professional, polite and have fixed my car issues quickly at a reasonable price. They are a little out of my way, but I'll happily drive the extra miles since I fully trust them to give my car the best care. Here's one example from over a year ago. I took my car into a Toyota dealership for a 30,000 mile check up and they came back with a quote of about $4000 to fix issues with my car that I didn't think even existed, plus my car was running fine! I ignored the Toyota dealership's suggestions. A few months later I drove to Utah, did some off roading and my check engine light came on a day later. I took my car into Precision Imports and they discovered that it was simply some minor alignment issues and fixed it for $45! I asked about the issues Toyota mentioned and they said they didn't find anything like that. Let's see, Toyota told me my car problems about 25,000 miles ago and my car is just fine (FYI: I have over 180,000 miles on my car). Example two from last week. I took my car into Walmart for an oil change and to check out a slow leak in one of my tires back in February. They say they can't find anything wrong with my tire and suggest I get a new one. I put off buying a new tire and stick with just filling it up with air about once a week. My check engine light goes on again. I took it in to Precision Imports for my next oil change and to see if they find anything wrong with my tire. Of course they do. They found a four inch nail in the tire, patched it up and the slow leak is gone. Oh, they plugged in something that Walmart probably left unplugged too. $72 for an oil change, patched tire and to check out and fix the check engine light situation. I don't know much about cars, but these guys...these are good guys.",Positive
"I don't know if I can say anything original about this place. All of the previous reviews (for the most part) are SPOT ON! After a recco from a family friend, I have been taking our cars here for the past 4 years. Most recently I had a timing belt and some other normal maintenance done on my 05' Honda Accord V6. The cost was far better than the other quotes I had received (I wanted to see what the dealer wanted), and I don't know if Al or Frank have Thanksgiving plans, but my wife would love to have them and their family's join us! Honestly, the service from these guys is unparalleled! I TRULY felt like I had the work done by a friend. Go Here! I don't care if you have to get your car towed there from Eloy (God Bless You if you do), but do it... You can thank me later",Positive
"The test of trustworthy car pros is done over an extended period of time. I've been going here for 4-5 years. Frank and Al know their cars, talk to you in plain language and are honest when it comes to what needs to be done. Several times my ten year old Mazda is just shaking and moaning with age... nothing else.",Positive
"I can't say enough good things about this shop. Frank really knows what people need and that's honesty and trust. He never has once tried to pull a fast one on me. His costs are very low and the service is better than anyplace I've been to my whole life. Ever since I lost my father I've felt that everywhere I went with my car I was getting the wool pulled over my eyes....not here. You walk out of there feeling like you have a friend in the business and I'm not kidding. I've recommend this shop to everyone who had complained they have something wrong with their car. 7 cars, including mine, that will only go to Precision. I'll be a customer for life. Thanks Precision for restoring my trust in auto mechanics, my dad would have definitely approved of you all working on my cars.",Positive
These guys (Frank and Al) rock! They are honest and perform the work that needs to be done. Just know they are extremely busy and not open weekends. I hate to give out this secret but they are that good. Finally an automotive repair shop with integrity! I send my 20 year old daughters to them and feel confidant they won't take advantage of them. Highly recommended!,Positive
"Our car needed an oil change... and then, suddenly, the air would only blow warm. Never good in June! We made the mistake of taking it to the VW dealership, and was told that the relay (whatever that is...) needed to be replaced and that it would cost me $360. Ugh. Soooo... the Husband (much more knowledgeable about car stuff) gave Precision Imports a call. They told him to bring the car in to them and they'd make sure it was less. No kidding!! They got the work done asap, and only charged us $125. Savings of OVER $200! Now, THAT is good service! They just made loyal customers out of us... no more dealerships for our car!",Positive
"I love this place! A few years back my boyfriend introduced me to Precision Imports and I have never been happier they are honest and FAST! They never try to up-sale me on anything, which is a problem I always ran into with other places. I live about 45 minutes away now and still refuse to go elsewhere because they are worth it. I wish more businesses were like them.",Positive
My coworker suggested I take my car to Frank and AL after being dicked around by a dealership. They were honest with me about what my car needed and what it didn't and stood by their prices. I fully trust their suggestions as they are concerned with the longevity of your vehicle. Precision Imports is a true hidden jem!,Positive
Worse than the 7 eleven next to it. They charge you a 40 cent fee for each debit card purchace. This place is getting over on people and should be reported.. With your help we can shut this place down.,Negative
Asked if a restroom was available at 04:23 am after my shift was told by clerk to walk to a casino though I was waiting for the bus I asked the man what if im a customer he said I told you buddy we have no restroom I asked how do you use the restroom then you hold it he said nothing don't conduct business here.,Negative
"My dad, my aunt and I stopped by here to get gas on our way back from seeing Joan Jett perform on Fremont Street. From the looks of it, I told my dad not to pump gas here because it looked very sketchy with suspicious characters and very poor lighting. He and my aunt agreed with me and we found another gas station in a better area. Not a good place to be hanging around at night anyway, especially if you're alone.",Negative
"I wish I had a better experience at this Pump N Snack like I have always had when I visit Las Vegas. Usually there is a young man there who is very helpful and friendly. However I made the mistake of going late at night when there is this very old, rude, and crooked man working there. I have never had someone steal my money the way he intentionally did. He told me my total was $5.07. I gave him a $20 then I told him I had 7 cents in change. He took the opportunity when I was going through my change purse to pocket my $15. I insisted to have the police called to look to make sure I did not have the $15 in change. I waited 30 minutes for them to come. He still pretended like he didn't have my money. All the while his son, (who I believe is in on the scam) was watching and yelling obscenities at me. The old man went out to smoke as I waited inside to have the police come to solve things. I then asked him if there were coming, he then pushed me and called me a stupid bitch. Now, that I am over the initial shock of not receiving my money, and being physically and verbally assaulted, I will be pressing charges against this company. Please for your physical and financial safety, do not shop or get gas at Pump N Snack.",Negative
"There are lots of homeless people and drug addicts around this place begging for money. Most of them are harmless, but some of them can be downright aggressive and rude. Watch your belongings. This place isn't that far off the strip, but it certainly isn't a place I'd recommend. Sometimes saving a few pennies on gas isn't worth it.",Negative
Great gas prices and I like the mart! They have a great selection of snacks and their prices are fantastic! Super clean and the owner is very nice and helpful!,Positive
It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient.,Negative
"This is the ONLY place I have ever brought my vehicles to. Since my first car when I was 16 and I'll be 30 this year..they are so kind, knowledgeable and honest. To me that is the most important. I now live in tempe Arizona and still make the commute even if it's a simple oil change. Thank you Harry and Scott and the rest of the Purcells team for always doing honest work at a fair price.",Positive
"Wonderful place to bring your car. Very professional, friendly, and reasonably priced. A co-worker recommended this place and I'm glad I took the recommendation.",Positive
"Got two new tires and they were done the entire process of putting on, rotating, and aligning my new tires in far less the time that they said it would take them! (1 hour) Rocky at the counter was straight forward and informative and didn't push me into anything I didn't want to do.",Positive
"Great service! Stopped in to make an appointment for two new tires, and they took me in right away. Very pleased. Reasonable price. Highly recommended.",Positive
"My family had been using this service station for as long as I can remember. My parents, and my grandparents recommended I use them whenever I needed something done for my car. Glad I listened. Scott is a great guy, who will pick up my car while I'm at work and drop it back off when it's finished. Harry is one of the most honest gentlemen in the industry--I wouldn't take my car to anyone else.",Positive
Took my SUV to Harry for a bad vibration. Turned out to be bad tires(not very old Coopers). I unfortunately bought the vehicle with the tires on it so I had no proof of purchase. Harry sold me a set of Hankooks. Love them and no more vibrations or road noise. Has another customer for as long as he wants me.,Positive
"My mom had been complaining about her car leaking this and that, and potentially not being safe. I live out of town, and I was concerned. While visiting Phoenix last week, my sister, my mom, her car and I went to Purcell Tire & Service where we met Harry Fuller. Harry instantly understood the situation, found the most economical way to evaluate the car, and offered real solutions for a reasonable price. Harry was honest, clear, and forthright. I would definitely recommend taking your car problems to Harry. From here out, we will be faithful customers!",Positive
"When I rolled into town without my A/C working, I headed straight over to see Harry Fuller at Purcell's Tire for a solution. Gotta have your A/C in tip-top working condition in Arizona! With a little troubleshooting, my A/C was back up and running. I can't thank the guys enough for fitting me into their schedule on a Friday night on a holiday weekend to fix my car! Major kudos to this location/company. Thanks guys! I would recommend Purcell's to anyone who is in the area for A/C work or better yet...buy some tires here too!",Positive
"Friendly Customer Service is not in their Vocabulary My wife traded in her Lexus almost exactly two years ago and bought a Buick Encore from Randy Marion Buick GMC. So far no problems until today. She does have an interesting sense of humor and decor. The other day, she saw another Lexus with fake eyelashes and thought it was cute so she ordered a set for her Buick. She's getting ready to drive to Pittsburgh to see her grandchildren and On Star was indicating low tire pressure so she made an appointment with Randy Marion to have this check out among other things and inquired as to if they would install this decoration. Initially they said no but after talking with Chris, they said bring it on down around 2pm. She arrived around 2:10 and was told Chris had gone to lunch. They took care of the problem with the tires immediately but then she sat there for 45 minutes with no one to help. Finally she stopped someone to ask and he snapped back in a rude and abrasive manner, that he was talking to another customer. To which my wife said, I did not see another lady and there is a reason I'm wearing two hearing aids. If you were talking to some else I could not hear you. After all I'm 71 years old, I don't even know how to open the hood and all I want is someone to help add this decoration. Another 30 minutes and still no help so she picked up her decorations at the service desk and left after almost 2 hours. Granted the decorations are a bit of an unusual request but it's only double sided tape and would take less than 5 minutes to install. They pamper you when you're a potential customer but ignore you later. Would not recommend based on the rude treatment and lack of attention.",Negative
Great experience! Very happy with everything. Steve Vann was the best Sales Rep I ever dealt with. Highly recommended! Finance department was also very nice and helpful as well!,Positive
"Be careful, service department wanted to overcharge a repair, I had the good sense to NOT authorize the repair. Diagnosed was Fuel Tank Module to fix at over $1,000 + 2 rear brake caliper replacements @ another $900. Whew, when I know the car is 14 yrs old, decided to go elsewhere. Turns out it was much more reasonable, under $500 AND was NOT the Fuel Tank Module. It's a vapor sensor. Sorry, but this was a big problem in my book. The reason why I am posting this review is because it still cost me $85 for poor diagnostics. I will not return to this service department and in my opinion they should return my $85.",Negative
Everyone is very courteous; repairs were made quicker than I anticipated and I always receive a phone call following up on my experience after the fact which is much appreciated.,Positive
"Purchased: 2015 GMC Canyon (January 5th, 2015) Pros: Ryan Cappuccio- our sales associate- was friendly, informative and worked via text which was very cool. Ryan took his time even after staying late the night of purchase to explain the features of the truck as well as touch-screen menu options. Ryan also followed up a couple of days later to see how we were doing and if we were overall satisfied with the purchase. The associate doing the finalization paperwork was also very friendly and well informed- seemed to work tirelessly even with non-stop customers. Cons: Being the first of the year, there were not many incentives given by dealer, but we feel like Randy Marion could have done a better job pointing out smaller deals given by AA card, financing, etc... The time spent in the waiting room between negotiations was extensive, no refreshments offered- very bare bones service even when not busy with other customers. Overall impression: I had heard through friends at work that Randy Marion Huntersville was to be avoided. They have a bad local reputation for poor customer service and lying about performing services (i.e.tire rotation). However, I had a positive buying experience, even with the disappointing lack of incentives. Jury still out on the service department. Hopefully the service staff can energize and prioritize putting a good face back on Randy Marion Huntersville.",Positive
"I visited the dealership on a Tuesday evening, test drove the 2013 Verano and the 2013 Lacrosse and decided that the Verano was the vehicle I wanted to pursue. Researched their website and saw that they offered the 24mth Experience Buick 10k miles lease for $199/month with $1,259+taxes and fees due at signing. The main finance guy was closing another deal, so I talked to Ron, who proceeded to replace the $1,259 with $1,759 and tried to show me a higher-priced national advertisement. When I pointed out their website, he acted like it was the first time he saw it, and said that he wouldn't let $500 get in the way of a deal. It was late, so he was going to check on other incentives and would call me next day (Wednesday). Wednesday passed, so I called them late Thursday and talked to my sales rep, Zach. Told him that Ron failed to follow up on Wednesday, as promised. I asked Zach to get Ron to call, and Zach hung up to go talk to him. Zach then called me back himself with a quote: they could do $195/month with $1,259 total due at signing (emphasized twice that it would not be just down payment, and they had enough room to cover the taxes and fees). I asked him to apply the $1,000 lease conquest, as I am coming off another vehicle lease, which would lower my out of pocket to $259. He was going to check on that and get back to me. Friday afternoon rolled around, so I called back. Zach was out of the office, so I asked for Ron. He acted all annoyed that I bothered him, and proceeded to increase the needed amount due at signing by $1,000!! When I told him about the bait-and-switch from what Zach quoted me, he said that he wasn't on the phone, so he has no clue what Zach told me. He also offered a half-hearted apology for not calling me when promised or when I followed up, and said that he relies on his salesmen to remind him to follow up with customers. Really? I called Zach on his cell and he promised to have the GM Jeff Leahy call me the same day (still Friday). Did not hear anything until Monday evening (the 7th day after I told them I want to get a lease with them) and found out that Zach was out the whole weekend. Asked for Jeff, who seemed to not know anything about the situation. He listened intently and said that he would look to get the deal rolling again. Next thing I know, the finance manager Damon calls me, and he talks about a 39-month lease instead of the 24-month one, so I have to give all the details from the beginning to a fourth person... He also acted like he doesn't know who puts their offers on the website, so he couldn't speak about it... He went back to his desk to run some numbers, and called me back with the numbers similar to Ron, about $1,000 more out-of-pocket than Zach's quote. He proceeded to tell me how great of a deal that is, so I had to stop him and give him the customer perspective: nobody from their dealership follows up with the customer when promised; they either don't communicate to each other or they pretend to not know what each of them relays to customers; nobody knows who manages the sales offers from the website; and the icing on the cake, the bait-and-switch between sales and finance. My advice on this dealership: run away from it, as fast and as far as you can. They seem to have the old-school sleazy used car sales mentality, and don't seem to value educated new-car customers (harder to upsell). My impression is that they won't give you the time of the day, if you know where the vehicle price needs to be and if you are not a potential customer for gouged financing and insurance products.",Negative
"Brought my Genesis in to have it tinted. The driver's and passenger's side windows were okay (not perfect as there have been bubbles formed in certain areas), however the rear window is awful with bubbles and streaks around and near the bottom. (I did everything as mentioned by Frank for the aftercare regime - no washes, no rolling down windows, no A/C and no heat). Although it was redone by him or SOMEONE else from his team, the job wasn't any better. There was white foam left all over the window and even on the leather seats! Bubbles and streaks were still there. As full paying customers, we deserve excellent service with great results. There are shops that will do a 100% perfect job - but S Class is NOT one of them. If you are reading this, I urge you to find a TRUE specialist elsewhere. S Class.. You are more of an F Class.",Negative
"Fake ass place including all 5 star ratings!! Something tells me all these reviews are all fake or my car is a one off shit job. Such garbage tinting I completely regret coming to this place. The best part is after service, multiple calls the very next day were ignored and has over a week to return my many calls, txts or voicemails. Why these ppl are in business I don't know. I too should open a tint shop to get some easy money. Bottom line waste of time and $$",Negative
"I'm going to keep this short and simple as the picture will say it all. I had to come back to get my tints fixed because there were bubbles and they were peeling. When I rescheduled and came in, Frank didn't even speak to me to apologize. Instead, he got someone else to do his work so he wouldn't have to see me. Tints were fixed and replaced, left thinking everything is good. Few weeks later, front passenger window starts peeling. At this point, I'm not going to waste my time to drive that far to get it ""fixed"" and have it peel again. Especially when Frank can't even speak to me personally. Customer service should be the most important when in any business industry.",Negative
"I chose S Class based on their reviews here and elsewhere. They also have an instagram account where they show just about all their work so that you can see what they've done and it also helps to pick how dark you want to go. I called Frank and was able to get an appointment for the next day for a great price. I originally wanted tinting in blue but he explained that the good tint manufacturers don't make colored tints and they can only be ordered from China. For that reason I went with the standard grey/black tint which they give a lifetime warranty for. His brother ended up doing the tinting for me. S Class operates out of another body shop which was very professional; perhaps this is partially how they can keep prices so low. I was able to get it all done in less than 2 hours which was great. They appear to have tinting available in 5% increments and so I got 5% tinting in the back and 20% on the sides. I'd highly recommend S Class for their product knowledge, price, and customer service and may very well be back soon to tint my windshield!",Positive
"*******For people who are interested in seeing this guy named FRANK or anyone that represent this unlicensed, non-certified business!!!!******** This guy is so desperate and fake, he even asked me to delete his bad review. He'll entice u with a bunch of things that sounds good to the ears-don't fall for it. I got my car tinted this summer and he did such a horrible job. The tint film was not smooth. I thought after giving it a few days as he advised it would smooth out but NOT at all. I noticed my glass had scratches, bubbles on the sides, back windshield was NOT sealed correctly. He didn't clean up his mess thoroughly and broke my baby seat buckle cover. After contacting him..he gave me so many run arounds. Booked an appointment a few times but he NEVER even showed up! Wasted my time and money. I had to chase him down in hopes that i will just forget about it. Finally after more months and so...i seen him, he tried to explain that it's impossible to cover the dot matrix which is OF COURSE NOT TRUE if u are a real professional with proper tools. He offered no HELP, no SOLUTION and fed me MORE lies. Watch out! Explore or do your research online on how to TINT WINDOWS by REAL PROFESSIONALS. This way u have an idea on how tint job should be done. S CLASS AUTO TINTING claim to do a professional job but it's all a lie! Maybe to some ppl it's okay but if u really pay attention and want a proper job done, RUNNN from S CLASS AUTO TINTING. He advertise false information and will take advantage of u. I had just bought my car BMW 323i and got it tinted by him. There were bubbles on the edge and scratches on the window. The sides, especially the rear windshield was not sealed properly. U can see glare at night. He only has limited type of tints to choose from which sucks-so u really don't have much options. If u are unsatisfied with it..he will charge u to replace it. Seriously, be very cereful! I mean if u are the type to NOT care about quality of your car then thats up to u. But i would NOT recommend ppl to waste their money on this guy. Whenever u decide to do business with him get a proper receipt so incase he messes up your car u can claim it back with your proof of purchase. Quality over anything!",Negative
"A year ago I contacted Frank about my car window tint. I asked him specifically if he was able to do the dotmatrix. I was told yes he told me they were professionals and they could put the tint on the dot matrix (back window). It took time for me to get an appointment which was fine because he was nice guy and the reviews where great but once that day did come for my appointment he did not remember he had scheduled me. When the Job was done it looks great or so I thought. (I paid cash not recommended). Not even a month later the tint on the back window started to bubble big time. I contacted Frank with photos and told him, he basically took no ownership for it and told me that the dotmatrix could not be done. ( not true at all) he offered no solution just left me hanging. I'm sure a lot of people are happy with the work get done there but I would not use their service again and I would not pay cash.",Negative
"We went on a Friday night and had the all you can eat fish fry. It was perfect. The fish was light and flaky and NOT greasy. The fries were the best fries I've had in a long time. Crispy, tasty and not greasy. The views and weather were perfect. We had a nice relaxing time. I recommend if you want to get out of the City.",Positive
"Been coming here for years and love it. Most favorite time is during the winter and it is an excellent place to have your boat repaired as well at PRECISSION MARINE. Jim, one of the mechanics is the mechanics for the rich and famous, no kidding! PRECISSION fits the name for this repair facility for your boat.",Positive
Expansive marina with fun floating docks to walk on. Lots of perimeter parking. There is a restaurant and and a boat ride to partake of. There is overflow parking with a massive metal staircase to exercise on.,Positive
"We have rented here many times. Yes, they can get crazy busy some times so be patient. Someone from a few years ago mentioned the planks were splintering. They have all been replaced with Trex (man made) planking. You do not need a Tonto Pass if you are renting a boat. Everyone else entering the lake area needs one and you have to buy in town in advance. We just got back from a nice half day pontoon with the family. Not too crowded during the week and the water was perfect. Boat ran fine, no problems. Relaxing day.",Positive
"First off, this review is strictly for the boat rental service which has been on multiple occasions a complete and utter unpleasant experience. You would think such a job would lead the individuals working there to be pleasant and helpful. Couldn't be further from the truth. They are clearly miserable and always have the worse possible attitudes, any questions are met with hostility and disgust, they seem to try to encourage you not to rent a boat which leads me to believe the whole operation must be a front for some other type of enterprise because they can't be looking to turn much of a profit with the incompetent attitudes they posess. As a hiring manager I wouldn't give them a mop job. The marina on that beautiful lake should be ashamed those clowns are even a part of the experience.",Negative
"First time here and employees just treat you like shit, this place is nice and beautiful, but pple who run this place that's a def story. Renting a boat better have alot of money & the guy who helping you is no help at all, treat you like shit. ""If you don't like your job get another job."" Don't ruin it for the guests ""paying customers""",Negative
"My wife and I were in Scottsdale on vacation and went to the marina to rent a boat at 4pm. on June 21st 2014. The attendants, an older woman and a younger man, were rude, never once said hello. I asked if we cound rent a boat for a couple of hours; there brochure says 8am til 6pm. The lady ( and I use the word loosely) never once looked at me or my wife and said they close at 5 and that everyone is already returning their renatals. The man said thet we wont even get to be out their for hour since it takes 15 minutes to process the paperwork. They clearly had no interest in our business. They, likely they wanted to rush home and to hell with the customer. We felt totally unwelcomed. We felt like we were in the twilight zone. Forget this lake and visit Canyon Lake marina!",Negative
"This marina is rather run down now, and it was not a great build to begin with. The dock planks are all loose and splintery (don't walk barefoot!). The dock fingers are flimsy and wobbly, to the point of being dangerous at the ends. There are no cleats (!!) anywhere, just these weird metal loops you have to pull ropes through. They don't sell ice at the marina store. How weird, huh? You have to walk up the hill to the restaurant to get a little 7 pound bag of partially defrosted and refrozen ice. The service was friendly, but with a lot of rules. They'd smile while telling you that you can't do this or that. I have to say the guys at the haul-out were VERY friendly and helpful, and did a great job hauling out my big cruiser for me. The restaurant is your basic pub style fare, nothing to complain about and nothing to really talk about. Beautiful lake, but I wouldn't choose this marina again.",Negative
"I come for the ALL U CAN EAT Crab Legs...Only Saturday night...burgers are great too! Get here early with your comfy pants to enjoy every bit of crab you can literally eat. I enjoy the lake scene and sitting on the patio. Oh and the strawberry shortcake is enough for 4 people, seriously!",Positive
"This lake is a hidden lil gem... well, I'm sure it's well-known to people who have lived in the Phoenix area for a long time but we stumbled across it yesterday while driving around, taking pictures of cacti. (yeah - i know) It's so cute and quaint. Not a big lake or major water sports destination but, it has a lil restaurant and a marina... and yesterday it was a nice destination and provided some great photos. I'll return this summer!. :) See ya there!",Positive
"Saguaro Lake is a bit small, so you can't really let 'er rip here. But with soaring rocky cliffs and the occasional eagle overhead, it is beautiful. Plus it has two other nice features. First off, it is surrounded like loads of 4-wheeling trails. Whether you're looking to tear up the sandy washes or climb rocky hills, it's there. Also, there is a boat-in only campground - Bagley Flat. It contains maybe 10 sites, and several of them are on the water. The scenery can't be beat. But be aware, we encountered LOTS of skunks there and many non-stinging bees. We didn't get stinky or stung, but we did have to mind our manners while we were there. I would not hesitate to return though. Maybe I would pick a different campsite.",Positive
Love these guys. Awesome shop. Terrific people. Extremely prompt communication and never attempt to upsell or recommend work you don't need. I have used several other top tier auto shops around Phoenix area and these guys are by far my favorite. Allen from their performance division is and excellent guy and I met his Dad the first time I went to the shop. Dad took me for a tour around the shop and needless to say I was very impressed with everything I saw. There are a handful of less than stellar reviews on here and I have to say that these folks don't understand that auto repair shops can't operate without making a profit... Let me say that their quality of work is equivalent or better than a dealership and their prices are less.,Positive
"I love to give thanks and praise to businesses that truly are about the customers (not the almighty dollar), so I wasn't too surprised when I noticed that I reviewed them a few months ago, but I had forgotten. My ex has been dealing with another auto repair shop, and what started out as an oil change- has morphed into needing a new car because of their shoddy workmanship. I took it to SB for a second opinion (after noticing puddles of oil), and instead of taking my money for the repairs- they suggested the car go back for warranty repairs. We did, and it came back leaking even more and this time they tried blaming me by saying I obviously his the oil pan by the BIG dent that wasn't there the first time. I knew I hadn't hit anything and expressed my anger to Andy about that accusation. They lifted the car up, and took me back to show me that I in NO way hit anything because there wasn't a single scrape/scratch ANY WHERE on the oil pan ... just a HUGE dent. Although I knew it was the other establishment who had done this... Andi and her mechanics kept it professional by not bad mouthing the other business. So in addition to being extremely professional undeniably honest, and having the highest quality mechanics around... they are very humble and classy. I was willing to put a couple of thousand dollars into it (just to keep it a couple of more years), but again their integrity stood above the money I was willing to give then, and they (Andi and mechanic) didn't think it was a good idea given the mileage already on it. Once again I can't sing their praises enough, but if you are looking for high quality mechanics, owners who accept responsibility when something breaks while under their roof (see previous review), and just the kindest, most honest people ever... go to Salem Boys. Guaranteed satisfaction!!",Positive
"Salem Boys is amazing. They are always friendly and helpful! We have been coming here for a few years now but I am a new""Yelper""so until now have not reviewed them. We have recommended them to our friends however. I appreciate their professionalism. So far they have been able to do everything we needed. We do not feel they have ever tried to ""up sell""us. I highly recommend this place and will keep coming back.",Positive
"I was so disappointed in my first experience with Salem Boys. They had come recommended to me and I know of their radio show, so I had high hopes when I took my car in for A/C repair. First, when I made the appointment on the phone, I was told that they would be open until 6:00 p.m.. I told them I would be there shortly before 6:00 to drop off my car. No problem, she said. I got there at 5:50 and found the doors locked and lights off. I try to avoid leaving my car outside repair facilities as thieves know how to get into the night drops to steal the keys. Looks like I had no choice this time, so I dropped it off in the after hours box and kept my fingers crossed. I left a note with my keys expressing my displeasure with the early closing, which was never acknowledged. The next morning I received a call fairly promptly. To their credit, they evaluated the car quickly. The news was not good - replace essentially the entire A/C system for $2,350. Wow. For this price, am I at least getting Ford parts? No. Ok, what's the warranty in my shiny new aftermarket A/C system? One year. That's it. Not to worry though, I was assured they have had ""good luck"" with this manufacturer. I wasn't comforted by that. A quick Google search found manufacturers that will warranty their products for 3 years. Sounds more reasonable. I advised them I would be picking up my car. When I picked up the car, it was a very disinterested interaction. Not exactly rude, but no conversation or attempts to see if there was any other way to help me. $48 please. Ok, fine. I decided to check around and compare prices. I called the dealer first. I asked for a price to do the same work Salem told me they would be doing. The dealer was $200 less expensive and I would be getting OEM parts with a warranty twice as long. I've never heard of the dealer being less than an independent shop before. I managed to find another facility (with excellent reviews) that would do the work for $300 less and a warranty for 3 years. Still expensive, but head and shoulders above the Salem quote. I ultimately had the work done there and it appears fine for now. I was left wondering what benefit Salem Boys was offering. Price - no. Quality - no. Service after the repair - no. Service - no. It's unfortunate, but Salem Boys missed an opportunity to gain a customer.",Negative
This place is awesome! My husband brings his truck here all the time for standard maintenance and enhancement. Of course he has a 2500HD diesel truck. But still the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Recently I was having transmission issues on my 16yo Jeep. She was having trouble shifting gears and of course she is so old I worried about the life of my Jeep. My husband was able to drop it off and they got to it when could. A few days later since my Jeep was not wanting to replicate its issue they finally were able to determine what was going on and fix it! Since I have gotten my Jeep back I have been driving it like normal and I have had no issues! It's good to know at Salem I don't have to worry about my vehicle because they make Sure they do it right the first time! Thanks!,Positive
"I called salem about getting a transmission replaced as well as a rear main seal on my 1997 f250 hd. The lady that answered the phone was extremely professional and polite. She took my vin number and my name and number and said she would call back the next day. It's been several weeks with no call back. I tried calling back but they have no recollection of my call. I have heard very great things about salem, but I'm a customer with cash, that is willing to pay more for quality work and it seems like they don't want to take on the job. If that is the case, tell me that up front. I would be nervous to have work done if that is the case.",Negative
"Salem Boys Auto is an Elite auto shop! They have done work on both of my trucks. Their superior knowledge of the mechanics of diesel motors impressed me. They have done repairs and enhancements for me on my 2002 truck that I use to haul my LQ horse trailer. When I decided to buy a new truck, it was comforting to have a trusted mechanic to get advice from. Salem Boys Auto cares about their customers and has a genuine concern for their safety. I appreciated the facts, and practical understanding, I gained from Mark regarding what size truck I needed to haul my heavy trailer. I now also comprehend tire speed and load rating! I love that they are a family owned shop, being a customer is like being family, even though they had just met me. Thank you Salem family.",Positive
"This was the first time that my wife and I have heard about, and visited Salem Boys auto. We took our truck to Allen to see if he can fix our 5th Wheel hitch. Not only that Allen and his team helped us with it, he didn't even charge us for his time. This, to me was what I called, customer service! Now that we know about this shop, we will definitely give them our future business. Thank you Allen!",Positive
"Honest, competent, friendly, respectful. I received a clear, written description of what my car needed, and the work was completed ahead of the time promised and for a little less money - classic ""under-promise, over-deliver.""",Positive
Here is my input regarding whether or not Salem Boys is pricey or not. Not long ago I took a job in customer service for a large Dodge dealership near the border of Chandler and Tempe. Their outbound telephone solicitors make commission for every customer they call who agrees to bring in their car for routine maintenance such as oil changes. The repair shop supervisor and mechanics make commissions based on how much higher the ticket is above the reason you brought your car in. The more repairs they tell you need to be done the more commission they make. If you only have your oil changed and nothing else it hurts their pay check and puts their jobs in jeopardy. They have quotas that must be met. Their salaries are very low. To put food on their tables they rely on these commissions. Also you must get a certain percent of customers agree to a test drive of a new vehicle with a sales person when they bring their car in for repair. I know Salem Boys does not do this because when I first brought my car in I spoke to Andy or some other nice lady and advised them I would not do business with any mechanics who do this.,Positive
"DON'T do it! $1400 for a/c repair when compressor went out. Lied and said had to replace the drier too in order to get warranty on compressor -- I called around and that is NOT true. Compressor was the ONLY problem I had. After I got it back, started with problems of cold, then heater would come on when A/C selected. Finally ONLY heater. Funny, that wasn't an issue BEFORE I took it to them. Took it back and they said now they need another $250! NO WAY! It's blowing hotter than BEFORE I took it in. To top it off, the guy on the phone was a JERK and talked down to me and was rude. NEVER, EVER again. Save your money! Go elsewhere! AND they won't put you through to owner when there is an issue. Guess he's used to these calls and doesn't want to bother dealing with customers. One star is too high. They have a very nice shop, but they can afford it with the money they steal from taking advantage of single women. Oh, and they scratched up the console on my car in the process! Gee, THANKS! And in response to your response: I did not treat your daughter in any negative manner, I did not talk to your daughter in any negative manner, and I definitely did not threaten your daughter! So again there is a definite problem at your shop. And I, too, am not just single, I am a widow and I have four kids.",Negative
"I drive a pretty old car that needs a lot of stuff fixed on it, and I just can't afford Salem Boys anymore. Every time I walk in, I come out with two grand worth of stuff that needs to be done. Granted, most of the time they're right about what needs to be fixed, but I can usually find a place to do it at 75% of the cost. And I know that they do the boogeyman thing and tell you that many shops will do inferior work, but there's also a lot of shops that will do good work for not as much money. Sad face.",Positive
Great customer service. Alan will bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. It's good to see a family owned and operated business in the valley that's been around a long time and still prospering. Made my wifes car look fantastic with some new wheels.,Positive
Always honest and excellent service. Often go there to have my nissan altima or 280ZX serviced. If they can't find a problem they will let you know and not give you any unwanted repairs. They always tell me up front what the costs will be so never a shock. pIty they aren't open on the weekends...,Positive
"I am in debt to Mark for helping us on more than one occasion, correctly diagnose issues with our trucks. If I lived closer, I'd be using his crew for anything to do with our vehicles. I believe in Mark, his experience and knowledge. He steered me to a shop close to home, even called them for me to tell them what he though one issue was and saved us the expense and time of needing a new engine in our truck. After two mechanics, we were ready to give up. Thank GOD for Mark. We would probably have blown a lot of money by now. Can't say enough great things about him.",Positive
"I've been taking my Ford Escape here for years after getting poor service from the local dealer. Salem boys has always recommended service when necessary, and more importantly, declined the opportunity to perform service that they didn't feel was necessary. They keep good records of the maintenance that they do on your car, so they can tell what's needed and what isn't. During the Christmas break, our alternator failed and they took the car. Unfortunately, they couldn't complete the repair because parts didn't arrive in time (from our local Ford dealer, I suppose) so we used their rental car for a reasonable free. We had a problem with that too, which no one could have foreseen. Within 20 minutes after we called them, Mark and Andi showed up at our house with a spare rental car, fixed the original rental car on the spot and drove it home. If you have a problem they'll make it right. I especially like the fact that when they make a service recommendation they just lay it on the table as a choice -- I'll sometimes defer a maintenance operation to a later date and they always accept my decisions without argument.",Positive
"Best customer service I have experienced in an Auto repair Shop. I had been shopping around for a garage that would install an aftermarket DLR Kit for my car, as well as some LED strips. The Quotes I was getting were ridiculous, in the order of 4 to 6 times what I paid for the materials. The CFO in my company, who happens to be a big Car enthusiast, recommended a couple of Shops, one amongst them Salem Boys. Shortly after, I began corresponding with Alan, who immediately took care of me and offered the most competitive pricing out of all the shops I had contacted. Installation was completed in a few hours and I was a happy customer...But wait... Calamity! After a couple of days i noticed that the LED kits were flickering and changing intensity. I called Alan, he had me bring the car in the very next day to get re-wired. You'd think that was the end of that! But unfortunately it was not! After a couple days I once again noticed The LED's were still flickering. Without a second thought Alan asked me to bring the car back in and they kept it for most the day to ensure that the problem will not present itself again. When I picked up my car Alan asked to please contact him again if the issue reoccurred, that we would get it fixed no matter what. But fortunately for all those involved, the issue was fixed. All throughout these 3 trips to the shop, I did not pay a single penny more; My calls were always promptly, professionally and courteously handled and I was transported to and from work on their courtesy shuttle. They have made a customer for life.",Positive
"Salem Boys Auto is amazing! I took my car to a Toyota dealership with a problem. They told me I needed several thousands of dollars worth of work, along with a lot of time without my car while they repaired it. I called Salem Boys on the recommendations of friends and they were able to diagnose the problem and repair it in just a few hours, and for a fraction of the cost I was quoted at a dealership. I have not had any issues with my car since. I cannot say enough good things about Salem Boys, the people who work there, and the quality of the service I received! I will be taking my car here from now on.",Positive
"Fantastic shop. Every man of a certain age has a long life-list of mechanics shops he's visited; for me, most were remarkably 1) disgusting and 2) unhelpful. Hard to say why this is, but it may be that auto repair selects for rather rough-hewn guys. Anyway, this place is not only immaculate, but beautifully decorated with lots of interesting car-culture stuff. More to the point, in my experience they can fix things no one else can, such as a vacuum leak in my wife's Celica that had thwarted two other garages. Not cheap, but the price is fair. Truly refreshing to see pride of ownership and workmanship in this operation.",Positive
"Took my wife's car to get an oil change and got great service. They let me know abut an issue with the hood but there wasn't any ""phantom issues"" you usually get when you change your oil. I would go again.",Positive
"Without going into detail about my experience I will just say this--WHATEVER YOU DO get another quote from another reputable shop, believe me, there are plenty to choose from at almost HALF the price!!! This place charges TOP DOLLAR and then some--even my dealer was cheaper, seriously?!",Negative
"They fixed my gf's car just fine, and she has several family members that take their vehicles here, even the picky ones. So, based on that and my 1 time personal experience with them, 4 stars.",Positive
"A customer's worst nightmare! If they can ""fix anything,"" then why couldn't they correctly replace the shocks and struts on my car?! Salem Boys also could not stand behind their own work in my case. In February 2010, I took my car to Salem Boys to have the shocks and struts replaced. Here's a condensed version of my story. Failed Attempt #1: The mechanic didn't have the shocks seated properly, so they popped in and out of place. Don't they test drive the vehicle before they let the customer drive it home? Failed Attempt #2: There's a metallic rattling noise that can be heard from inside the car. I go back to Salem Boys again, ride with the mechanic. He thinks he's fixed it. Failed Attempt #3: The rattle comes back and a new problem develops. I ride with a second mechanic. Thud, thump noise, and slow compression/rebound due to a defective shock. Was it incorrectly installed again? I don't know, and never find out. Salem Boys replaces the shock. Failed Attempt #4: Excessive bouncing, feels like shocks are soft. I contact Mark Salem directly. Immediately takes defensive approach. Eventually, I have to take the car to get the work done correctly somewhere else. Salem refers me to the manufacturer to get a partial refund. He won't acknowledge the fact that the car has been in his shop several times, and unsuccessfully repaired each time. I had the shocks replaced by mechanics who were qualified and specialists in Japanese imports. They discover Salem Boys incorrectly installed the front struts.... The events above started from 02/16/10 until today, 07/23/10, so far. I highly recommend that if you have a problem with Salem Boys Auto, address it immediately and make sure you have documentation of every failed attempt to fix your car, even if you're having to go back and have them fix the same recurring problem. Request a receipt if you are not given one. There's no guarantee the BBB will resolve your dispute; however, it's important to notify them, so if a pattern develops, it can be addressed, and eventually affect the rating. The Attorney General, Federal Trade Commission, local news, small claims court, and the Automotive Service Excellence staff can all be contacted for assistance if you believe you're being unfairly treated. ASE states they don't normally handle complaints, but if they get enough complaints about the same shop, they may also address the issue(s). If any shop fails to provide you with written documentation of a subsequent visit to their shop for any attempt to repair or correct a mistake they made, notify the Attorney General's Office as soon as possible. 09/12/12 edit. The truth is that there were only two offers, not four, as Salem claims in his response below. I saved his emails with those ""offers."" Salem did not offer a refund for the labor in either offer, even though both his mechanics failed to properly fix my car. His offer #2 was ""upgraded"" shocks from the same mfg, but his mechanics would still have to do the work. Given Salem's terrible track record with my car, I went with offer #1 because I knew something was still wrong, and the car needed to be fixed. Offer #1 was the shock manufacturer allowing a refund for the shocks, but not the labor. When I took my car to the Honda certified mechanics, they alerted me that the shocks Salem's shop had installed were were not properly seated, causing problems once again. Bolts were also not tightened, and a part was missing. Salem was not concerned with doing the job right or my safety, mind you, only with keeping the money for the labor even though I asked for a refund. Salem breached the contract by not performing the last installation properly, and still kept my money. I wasn't going back to any other offer. I was asking for a refund for the labor which was owed me regardless of any offer, but Salem for some reason felt he was entitled to the money for doing the job wrong. When the owner of a repair shop charges a customer for his mechanics' mistakes, how is that ""putting the customer first?"" How is that not stealing from the customer? Any offer made to the customer does not excuse a shop from having to do the work properly. I didn't break the contract since Salem already had my money. Salem simply would not refund the money for the labor even though he was at fault. Really?! Dragging this on for 4 months was ""trying to make me happy?"" My only mistake was going there in the first place. If I can save someone else the trouble of having to go through this, then that's satisfaction in spades for me.",Negative
"I HAVE HAD WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES EVERYTIME I HAVE HAD ANY INTERACTION WITH MARK OR HIS CREW. if he can't fix it he will send you to just the right place that can. i even sent my mother in law to one of his referals. too good to be true but he is. he even guarantees his referals, if his shop doesn't do the work and you go somewhere he recomends he will do the fighting for you if you get no satisfaction for something bad done by his referal.",Positive
"When the biggest complaint is that they're too good, you know you've found a good repair shop. And that's the case with Salem Boys Auto in Tempe. They're widely recognized for the quality of their work. And that means, unfortunately, that you can't always be squeezed in at the last minute, and also that they've had to stop accepting new customers more than once. They play as hard as they work, though, and are closed entirely on Saturdays. Not the shop for you if you can never be rid of your car during the week. (They do offer rentals on-site at reasonable rates, but that doesn't make it any more convenient or make the repairs take any less time.) Assuming you can mesh their schedule with yours, though, you'll get work done well, done right, and done using only the highest-quality parts. They also have techs who know how those funny-lookin' carb-o-rater things work, which can be a godsend if you've got an older ride. I've used them for years, and save for one incident that wasn't entirely the tech's fault, I've been happy. They're also the only shop I've found in town that has access to some kind of mystical interchange database nobody else does--if you have a mutant vehicle like, say, an AMC-era Jeep, they can probably find the obscure part you need that nobody else can. Super mega bonus points for solving emissions problems by actually taking the damn car to the emissions test station. I've had a couple vehicles fail emissions over the years, and Salem Boys was the only shop that ever handed me back my keys and an emissions certificate. Everybody else's solution was ""Well, we did X and it passed our sniffer now, so take it to emissions and we'll charge you for another repair if it doesn't pass.""",Positive
"I bought 3 new cars at this dealership and faithfully returned to them for service over a number of years. I had a few service issues during that time and each time I found Anthony uninterested and dismissive. These are three of the more significant issues. 1) buying new tires and having to pay extra for balancing because the rear wheels were too large for them to do in house... then paying again a few months later to get them re-balanced because of a high speed vibration. Anthony's position was the lack of correct balancing was not his problem because it took a couple of months for me to bring the car back in. 2) A defective key sensor unit was replaced under warranty during the winter. In the spring I discovered the automatic climate control was not working. I googled the system and found that the climate sensor was next to the key sensor that had been replaced and told Anthony this when he was preparing the service work order. He could have said ""ok, thanks, we'll check that out"". Instead he said ""it's not related to the previous repair, the climate sensor is in a different area of the passenger cabin. It turned out the climate sensor had been disconnected during the previous repair and the fix was to reconnect it. 3) I had my car detailed. After I got my car home I noticed a circular gouge in the flat surface finish of one wheel. It was in a location and in a shape that could not have happened by wheel rash. It looked like the ""chuck"" of a buffing tool had contacted the surface during detailing. I didn't expect the dealer would do anything for me because of the lack of ""proof"" on the cause but mentioned it to Anthony anyway with me next service. His response was classic Anthony, he said ""they don't use rotating tools to buff your wheels during detailing"" lol. My impression is Anthony believes it is part of his job to shut down and close off customer concerns and deny any responsibility. I admit I got a bit heated during these incidents, but despite this I still maintained loyalty to the dealership and kept bringing my cars back to them. No more. The final straw happened when I brought my car in for service last week.. There were two staff behind the service counter. Anthony was free, the other was busy. I asked Anthony to check my car in. He refused, saying I didn't like him and had said nasty things. I could have waited for the other service representative to finish but standing there while Anthony grinned at me is not the reward I expect for years of loyalty. So I'll be going to a different dealer for my future needs. I did leave a phone message for the service manager informing him of my decision to leave and why... and got no response. Nice",Negative
"My family went to this dealership to buy a used Buick Enclave that they marketed for sale. The sales man and his manager were both quite unprofessional! My family has never experienced such unprofessional and terrible customer service. Testing driving the car was a mess, first they were told that the gas is low and when they came back the sales agent (his name is Syed) refused to as they didnt agree on a price yet. Dont you need to test drive before agreeing on a price? His manager was just as bad and ran around the dealership making himself appear important when he was just a total waste of space. My family outrightly said that they are buying the car and are paying cash yet the sales man and his manager weren't able to negotiated properly and close out a deal that was only $300 apart. Whats worst is that they were rude! We found a much better car at a different dealer and got the right service and professionalism from the sales team. Please dont waste time going to this dealership. I am giving them 1 star but I would give less if I could!!",Negative
"Brought my 2014 Nissan Pathfinder in to fix an electrical issue. Picked up the next day and I happily paid them the $120 dollar fee of fixing the problem. The problem was not fixed. I took it to another mechanic to confirm the issue and Nissan had not done a thing to fix the problem. They happily took my money without making any repairs. The manager gave several excuses when I demanded my refund. He couldn't care less. Stay far away from this dealership. The worst dealership in the GTA. The service was so bad, I'm considering buying another brand instead of continuing with Nissan.",Negative
"Echoing all the other reviews here. The auto service department here is awful. Every time I've been here, it's been for something simple like an oil change, yet it always takes much longer than the service rep's estimated time. But the last time really took the cake with a whopping three-hour wait. They must've forgotten about my car because they didn't even get on it until I asked them what was taking so long at the two hour mark. A well-deserved one star.",Negative
"Scarborough Nissan provided the worst service I have ever experienced. In fact it was so bad that I walked out before they even started. I made an appointment for 10:30am and had been told when booking the appointment that it would take 2-3 hours and it would be no problem to shuttle me to a location within the shuttle boundaries. I arrived on time for my appointment and was told that 10:30 was just an appointment to ""check in"", not to have the car serviced at that time. Apparently all an appointment means is that you get priority over walk-ins. They said it could be hours more. I was also told it could be an hour or more before they could shuttle me anywhere as the shuttle had recently left and they had no idea how long it would be. This dealership shows zero respect for customers' time. Like most people, I could not just leave the car with no idea how long I may be waiting there - perhaps all day, so I had no choice but to leave. I did not even receive an apology from the employee I was dealing with - I was spoken too as if I was an idiot for not understanding that appointments do not mean that the car will be dealt with in a timely manner. Horrible experience. I will never return to this dealership.",Negative
"I've visited a lot of Nissan Dealerships around the GTA, but this one is probably one of the better ones. I say this because I appreciate their parts department and their willingness to help me with all questions I have in person or on the phone. All their parts department employees are very friendly and knowledgeable about the products I am asking advice or prices on. The parts department is usually super busy so they will likely have you on hold or waiting for a bit, but once you get though they are super helpful. The service department is also helpful. Although I do most of my own work, I've had questions about service intervals and about maintenance, which they were all willing to help out with. The prices are a little steep for most services, but that is expected with the dealership. The reason I am giving 3 stars instead of 4 is due to the sales department. I find most of the time if I'm looking at the new car lot, no one is ever there to ask me if I need help or if I want to sit inside the car. The sales team are literally sitting around and don't even bother to say ""Hi"" when they walk by. I'll stick around for parts and service, but I don't think I would purchase a new car at this Dealer.",Positive
Unpleasant experience before work was even done. Their website to book appointments doesn't function. There's no indication of this on the website. What's the point of even having it? I made an appointment on September 9th for September 13th and I had to call and see if my appointment was valid. This is NOT a great first impression. Giving this experience 1 star is being generous.,Negative
"I haven't come across anything even close to their attitude which has shown no concern at all for my time. They retained the car for a repair for which they had no parts in stock to only discover that after 5 hrs when actually the repair was supposed to be performed already. Which from the discussion I had seemed like completely normal to them. Well, if every similar experience would be the same, I would need to double my life time or my day from 24 hrs to 48 hrs to be able to accomplish everything I need. The entire experience told me that they don;t care at this time about customer satisfaction..",Negative
"If you're looking to turn heads with your vehicle, scorpion is the place to be. With a CNC machine onsite, these guys can weld and fabricate anything! Bumpers, skid plates, roof rack etc! I love the customization! It's not cheap, but would you trust cheap with your life on the line? Can't wait to come up with more things modify on my Lexus. Keep up the great work!",Positive
"3-10-18 Dino and his team are awesome! Great work and great prices. I would recommend to anyone. Thank you for the great job on my can-am!! 4-5-18 Came back for more work on my truck since I was so pleased with them the first time! Same result, awesome job on my truck! Travis knocked it out of the park. Thank you guys!!!!",Positive
"I've heard of these guys for years from friends into off-roading but didn't actually meet them until this year's Winter 4x4 Jamboree. Having an Xterra my options are limited to put it lightly. So I popped into thier shop, told them what I wanted, and they said no problem. I put down my deposit, dropped the truck off at the scheduled date and the work began. Fast forward to picking up the finished product, I couldn't be happier. It's exactly what I wanted and in a reasonable time frame. The guys there are regular Joe's like all of us and don't mind shooting the breeze like you're a long-time friend. I'll definitely go back for any custom Fab work I need done.",Positive
"I went in to get my 2004 Jeep Wrangler inspected. The guys in the shop jumped right in checking everything out. They found a couple of places that could use some new parts to tighten things up. I will be stopping back to make a "" shopping list "" of parts and bringing it back to them to install. Yes, from my experience I would recommend these guys.",Positive
"Knowledge about upgrades and options, vendor relationships to get answers I wanted, superior execution, a focus on making the customer happy. Not to mention welding that is nearly art. The entire staff demonstrates positive attitudes, and they look like they are having fun while working on your off road project. Great experience for me, Have one yourself.",Positive
Outstanding craftsmanship. The owner Dino was incredibly helpful. Highly recommend anyone looking for work on their Jeep or SUV.,Positive
"Custom rock sliders fit perfect and fabrication is super clean. Couple runs, couple hits and they feel solid. Team there is great, definitely recommend.",Positive
This is such an amazing place to go. I just bought a new bumper and no one would put it on because it was customer bought but when I called scorpion they got me an appointment the next day and were done within 2 hours of me dropping it off. I would recommend them to anyone. They are also extremely nice. I didn't get the names of the 2 guys who worked on my jeep but whoever they were were amazing. Definitely coming back soon.,Positive
"Scorpion came highly recommended by my fellow jeepers as to great work and very fair cost for what they do. I had the pleasure to bring my jeep to Dino and right from the start my experience was a good one. He was super cool on the phone setting my appointment and made me feel good about leaving my jeep for the work it needed to be done. Within no time at all they had my jeep running awesome to where it is actually enjoyable driving it again. I want to extend a huge shout out too to his guys in the shop, they were professional, helpful and knew what they were doing for sure. I will for sure recommend Scorpion Off-road to all of my fellow jeep people out there because service like they provide is getting very hard to find in this town. I really appreciate it and my jeep will be back for sure for more service. Thanks again Dino and crew. R.DeSouza",Positive
"I met Dino in one of our Las Vegas 4 Wheelers runs before I knew he had a shop. The man drives a beast of a rig that he fabricated. It looks straight out of the Mad Max movies...only not so crazy (guitar flame throwers not included). I'll have to remember to take photos next time. If you watch Count's Kustoms, the Count has nothing on Scorpion Motors. If you want some guy with a pair of polyacrylic horns doing your car then they might be the people to go to. A place that has a big reveal if they glue a new horn for you, then go there. I never trait a guy who has more horns than hair (or much sense if you watch the show on any regular capacity). If you want a sturdy build to go off roading that doesn't fall apart on you, and an owner who won't spin your head around with mumble jumble, then you come to a place like this. Dino used to have a fancy shop with the overhead if you look at his Twitter or Instagram feeds, but now he has a simple shop where he just builds things. Off topic, I used to visit this guys shop off East Sunset whose shop name started with a P. That man built cars for Hollywood including the Viper for the short lived Dodge Viper based series (a la Knight Rider). Now there's a custom fabricator. Funny, no fluff or reveal door there either. Down to Earth guy without fancy shirts or tv show. The better half stopped by his shop to ask about rock sliders for our 4Runner. Good thing she did because Dino noticed our wheel was loose. We had it lifted recently and our friend either forgot to put the pin back in or it broke off and the wheel was not secure. Good eye because no one caught it. Not even the guys from the meet ups. Anyway, because of this our upper ball joint was ruined and we had to get a new one. Whatever the result, Dino's quick eye saved a wheel from flying off while she was driving or worse, off roading with the group ( she already did it twice after it was done and I did it once in Logandale. doh!) Now that would suck. The part came in same day so we left the truck and picked it up the next day. We are going to put rock sliders (they replace running boards and are strong tubes that let your vehicle slide over a rock without bending), and a bigger skid plate in. The shop is a work shop and nothing else. At least you know he's not charging you to pay for a showy shop and calling it Dino's Kustoms with a silly reveal door. Careful to those guys who get reality TV crazy and shell out big dough for it. The Count is rumored to be building a trap door into the street so he can pop cars up and WOW people on his TV show when he reveals your car. Ok, maybe I exaggerate a little here...it's a trap door hoisted by Rolly (and probably some Oompa Loompas), but built into the street nevertheless. But if you want a straight up guy then stop by or give him a call for a quote. He knows his stuff. Or maybe you will see him off roading with one of the 4 wheel groups out there and can meet him. Super nice guy. If you read my reviews I am super stingy with 5 star reviews unless I think they really are on the up and up or does something that deserves a 5 star rating. I am pretty sure you won't get fleeced either. Dino sure is not charging you to pay for his fancy building or waiting area up front. Not sure if he does repairs besides upgrading, you may wanna call him for that. He works on Toyotas and Jeeps too. We have a Yota. I'll give an update on my sliders and plates when I get them on and installed.",Positive
"Came on a late saturday at 4:30pm, luckily he was working late and made time to check out my 4runner. Came in for a consult for rock sliders and skid plates. The owner Dino has a sharp eye and noticed that my driverside upper ball joint had come loose. He tried to tighten it for me, but the treads were already stripped. He called and ordered a new ball joint and it was done in less than half a day. Next up is rocksliders and a skidplate. I am very happy I brought my 4runner in when I did and his genuine concern for safety and informing me of what needed to be fixed was awesome. While you're at his shop, check out his cool buggy.",Positive
I recently bought a new 2015 Colorado pickup truck and I ordered some aftermarket parts online. my son goes to school in Minnesota and has become an auto body mechanic was going to put them on for me while he was visiting in town however they got back ordered and he had to return before the parts arrived. I started calling around trying to find a shop that would put the parts on. a bull bar and some side steps. I called the so-called 4 wheel drive shops and custom shops and they were all quoting me quite high prices. When checking on the yelp site I noticed a review that said they had a bad time at one of these so called great shops but had gone to scorpion motorsports and had a great experience. So I called scorpion on a Saturday and I got ahold of the owner Dino. He was very nice and helpful I told him of my situation and he quoted me a very fair price almost half what the other shops were quoting me. Not only that but it was Saturday and I have to work during the week and can't get free he said he would do it on Sunday for me which is unheard of!! I can't thank Dino enough for his great work and awesome prices. I highly recommend the shop and will be returning when I need more work done.,Positive
"I never post reviews but am so angry about my experience. On 12/9/17, I took my car in for a standard oil change and tire rotation. When I picked it up and started driving home, the steering wheel was shaking so bad, I was afraid to drive it. I would have taken it back to be looked at, but my son's birthday party was going to start in less than an hour and I had to get back home. I called the shop and the woman who answered simply said, ""You probably need your tires balanced, so bring it back in and we can do that for you for $19.99 per tire."" I called back to speak with the manager, who told me to bring the car back in and they would look at it. When I got home, my husband looked at the tires further and discovered that four lug nuts on one front tire and one lug nut on the other front tire were so loose and were about to fall out. We took the car back in the next day, and upon realizing one of his guys royally messed up and nearly caused a tire on my car to fall off, the manager lied to my husband and said he told me he would have had my car towed to Sears at no cost (he never told me that). Regardless, Sears fixed their mistake at no cost and we were on our way. Fast forward to January, when I went to drive my car into work and could immediately tell something was wrong. The issue was so bad that I drove my car to a reputable auto shop nearby and was notified by the shop that only two lug nuts were holding my tire on my car, meaning that when the car was taken back in December because the lug nuts were not tightened on the car, the Sears STILL DID NOT PUT THEM BACK ON PROPERLY. Because of this, the lug nuts literally came off my tire between December and January, causing the rotors to badly warp. Not once, but twice did they not put my tire back on completely. I have two children and take them to school every day. It sickens me to think that the tire on my car could have fallen off while I was driving my children, or while I was on the highway, or any other possible scenario. This could have killed my family and me. Stay away from this place! UPDATE: After filing a complaint with the BBB on 1/23/18 about my experience, I was finally put in touch with the district manager, Tom on 2/16/18, who offered to reimburse me for the price I paid to have my rotors replaced. On 2/19/18, I spoke with Robert from Sears corporate who was assigned to my BBB case. He said he was going to close my case with the BBB because no further action was needed and they were going to reimburse me for the rotors I had replaced. It's now 3/14/18 and neither Robert nor Tom from Sears are anywhere to be found, along with the check they promised me.",Negative
"Horrible, never again. One star only because I am forced to give one star or I can't post. I just spent Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday trying to get the alternator on my Son's car correctly replaced. They did the diagnostic and the repair. Said the car was done. Nope, there is a problem, come back tomorrow. Pick the car up Sunday, charging system light comes back on. While driving the car back to the shop on Monday, the car dies and has to be towed in. They say it blew a fuse, they replaced it, pick the car up. Now the car has no turn signals and won't shift gears. They look at it again, probably a wiring problem they say. They can't really fix those. So the old parts are back in the car, got a refund, turn signals work, car shifts. But still needs a new alternator. Done with Sears forever.",Negative
"I had an emergency, and the manager was kind enough to stay open the extra time it took to get things fixed on the car. Five stars all the way, I highly recommend Sears Auto Center! Thanks again!",Positive
"I moved to the area about a year ago, and I decided to do my summer to winter tire changes here for both of my cars. At end of March I had my summer tires placed on the car and I noticed that the tire pressure would be low in the front right every two weeks. So I check for nails and other things possibly being stuck in the tire, but couldn't find anything. So I figure when they mounted it that it didn't seal properly so I took it back to Sears. Upon visiting they said it was most likely a nail to which I told them i checked it multiple times and didn't find one. So after finishing with a couple cars in front of me they took it to the alignment rack in the back (instead of the front tire racks). They jacked up the car and then shot a nail right through the tire. I couldn't believe what I saw. He pulled the tire off to show me the nail and I immediately told him I saw him shoot a nail through it which he contested. Another mechanic came over and said ""either we can plug it for $30 or I'll put it back on and you can go somewhere else"". At this point you could see the air bubbling out from the nail so I knew they had to plug it. I told the manager that the mechanic put the nail through my tire and they were scamming me. He said he didn't believe me and charged me a little over $20 for the plug. Now the W rated tires can barely go over 100MPH (No more track days on these) for a company to make a few extra dollars. I would strongly recommend for any looking to have their car serviced to avoid this auto center regardless of the price they quote you. They will find a reason to charge more whether they have to create the problem themselves.",Negative
"First talked to them on the phone. They were very helpful and found what I needed. They were nice in the store too, but said they would call when the car was done and never did. I had to buy the tires and stuff online instead of through them do to it being cheaper and they at least told me how to get the best price.",Positive
"Nothing is worse than the mall. Except car repairs, well wife's car was due for battery and well I was at mall. Super price on expensive battery. They had installed in about 40 minutes. They offered choices and did not threaten that you need to buy best or you never start car in February. When it was installed, a code was needed for radio. They looked in auto manual and apologized when they could not find it. The idea they seemed to care was amazing. As a former auto parts person, once the cash is in hand most places will never see you again and that is the service you get. If you have a Honda, you need to have a code with you! Very nice counter and mechanical help. Even got a coupon to hopping inside for $5 off!",Positive
"I haven't had a accident in awhile, luckily it wasn't my fault. I was recommended to this location by my Allstate agent. This location has exceptional service from beginning to end, Karl Utakis did my initial quote, he was thorough with that quote. I questioned him on a few things regarding the process, parts that would be used, and I was pleased with the amount of detail from inside out that was going to be applied to my car. I got two other quotes and after review I knew after talking with Karl that service king was the shop to complete the work needed on my vehicle. The process was fast compared to my last experience with a body shop and when I checked the detailed report I received at the end of my repairs I noticed all of the things I asked about were done and then some. I had personal call updates from Karl between the entire repair time (10-business days) and they send out percentage progress text messages letting you know the status of the repair. Karl gave me a few options like paintless dent repairs, rock chip repair and blend on the hood for an affordable out of pocket cost. They have a professional sub contracted paintless dent repair guy Jeff that is a magician and worked his magic on multiple spots. This made the final result of my cars look to be near flawless, it's a well kept 10 year old Red Audi, before I brought it to SK it had some existing dents and rock chips now but now all around it almost looks new! I was reluctant to have my car worked on but I certainly have found trust in a auto body company after this experience. Give them a try, a quote doesn't hurt.",Positive
"People do yourself a favor and look for another place. I took my car to SK after a minor accident and was left with major damage. They said they fixed it but have been having so much problems with my car ever since. Since I got my car back I knew something wasn't right but they kept on coming with the ""nothing wrong crap"" at this point in paying for any repairs out of pocket. I rather do that than seeing this people again. Worst mistake Allstate did when they recommended them. I'm even thinking of switching insurance. If they recommended such crapping business maybe they too are the same. So sad that after having same insurance for 50 years now we are highly considering going somewhere else .",Negative
"My car was recently rear ended while I was stopped at a stop light. I was working through Allstate and they suggested going through one of the shops they work with: Service King. They would pick up my car from the tow yard and handle everything. They retrieved my car and started the process the same day as the accident. They sent the authorization to look at my car to me by email and had me do a digital signature. Only complaint is that I sent the authorization back the same day and a few days later, I received a call asking why I hadn't sent it back yet. Must have missed it in their computer system. Not a big deal at all. Otherwise, the process was seamless. They kept me updated the entire time regarding the status and when they anticipated it would be completed. They got it done two days ahead of schedule. When picking up my car, I was going to be just making it before they close because when I got off of work. Five minutes prior to close, I realized that I was not going to make it because of traffic and gave them a call. They were awesome. The guy that answered (didn't catch his name) said he was going to be there until 6:30 anyway and if I showed up by then it was okay. So, he let me pick up my car a half hour after closing and get on my way. That is awesome customer service and they were really understanding. I would definitely recommend them. The work on my car seems to be well done.",Positive
This Service King is outstanding. You receive text messages on a daily basis with updates as well as phone calls. Car suppose to be in the shop for 9 business days and we got ours back after 4. Car looked brand new. Could not be more pleased with them.,Positive
"2014 Civic: I was rear ended and felt very comfortable leaving my car at this shop on a Monday. Brian constantly updated me about my car via email and telephone calls which was very much appreciated. They got my car all fixed by the end of Friday and since I couldn't make it by the time they closed they allowed me to pick it up the next morning without a holding fee. Just wonderful all around service in person, in shop and over the phone. Thank you Service King, I'll be sure to refer you in the future!",Positive
"I bought a lexus is350 with the only issue being a front lip spoiler that needed repainting. I brought it to 3 places, the first place was highly touted online and on yelp but they wanted 750 to do the job. I then went to maaco who wanted 250. I was the on the verge of dropping my car off there but was scared off because of the general opinions of maaco online (maaco is franchise owned so I know experiences can vary from location to location). I just so happen to work near service king so dropped by to get a quote. They charged only slightly above maaco and said it would take them two days. I agreed and they gave me two day estimate. ...they updated me while they had my car and in two days it was ready. On inspection, it looks brand new, they gave me instructions on when I could wash the car and back it up with a lifetime warranty. I have no regrets taking it there and will be back if I have to get anything else painted......rock chips in AZ..... :(",Positive
I have never felt more comfortable at an automobile shop. I trust what they tell me and they do not try to find odd things to fix just to tack extra money onto my bill. I love this place!,Positive
"There are two parts to this review. First, the good. I brought my car in through Allstate after getting rear ended. The team at the Service King I went to got my car in, had the rental setup and took care of the damage and returned the car to me in the pre-accident shape. I was pleased very much with the repair work and ease of the rental car process. Now, the bad. When I dropped my car off, my son left his Ipod touch in the car. When I picked the car up, it was gone. I know there are pictures taken, but they aren't taken while I'm there so what's the point of the pictures? I called the store and eventually talked to the regional manager who said they'd get back to me with a fair resolution. Here we are 3 months later and never did I get a call back or any resolution. I'm extremely disappointed in the follow up.",Positive
"Chev Suburban driver door & fender repair completed promptly & professionally. Same vehicle repaired couple years previously following extensive damage to front end by hit & run driver, with the same exceptional level of service. Awesome finish & paint quality both repairs. Thought they went above & beyond normal servicing requirements to insure that everything was shipshape, & customer kept apprised of progress during repair days.",Positive
"If i could leave negative stars I would. Start with I was side swiped and I informed them that truck not driving right and alignment and front end mechanical needs to be looked at they were hesitant at first. Long story short they missed Major mechanical items (front transfer case internal damage) wind noise never fixed. They were condescending when I was speaking to them about my repairs and what I felt was going on they told me ""well your not a mechanic"" 6 months later and another six thousand dollars later the insurance company totaled out the vehicle because first shop missed so many items.",Negative
"Two months later and I'm still waiting for the car stereo case that came with the radio they installed, plus I spoke with Scott on 3-16-13 and he said he would look into it. Spoke to Kenneth yesterday and he had the negative attitude to tell me that a detachable stereo does not come with a case!! That's like saying a the right shoe does not come without the left shoe. A company says alot about the people they employ, and while Scott is VERY good and knowledgeable, there are some individuals who need more training and customer service at this location. Its okay Sterling, I just sent Allstate a message, they will contact you and to fix he over spray. The last comment and FACT is if you would have done the job right the first time, you would not have a bad business review. I will update my experience whenever my truck gets fixed. Next month, next year.......you tell me. Meanwhile I""ll send corporate a message to follow up.",Negative
First class repair center that is customer oriented with fast service. I recently used This Sterling repair center to fix my Lexus and the repair estimate was reasonable. They completed the repair to my satisfaction and my vehicle was available ahead of the planned date. Special thanks to Scott who was professional and courteous!,Positive
"A few months ago I was side-swiped sitting at a red light and my driver side mirror was snapped-off by a very impatient driver. I went in to Sterling on a Tuesday morning a few weeks ago with a replacement mirror I bought on-line and was out in little over an hour, and not as light in the wallet as I expected. Professional and timely service for such a busy shop. Rates are right in line with other shops in the area. If I ever need any further body work, I will definitely go back.",Positive
"I had a terrible experience with Sterling Auto Body in Peoria. After I was involved in a front end collision I had my vehicle towed to Sterling at the recommendation of my insurance company. I was told that because they were a direct repair network shop the tow would be free. They ended up billing my insurance company $80 for the tow. After about three weeks I got a call that my car was done. As I drove it home I realized how dangerous the car was to drive. The brakes were not adjusted properly after the car was put back together. If someone test drove the car before they called me they would have realized how dangerous the car was to drive. I immediately took the car back. The second time I picked my car up I noticed that the bumper was not lined up correctly and it had a rattle when I drove. The bumper was fixed but I was told the rattle was normal because my car was ""older"" (2007 with less than 25K miles). After I picked up my vehicle the third time I took it to Firestone and explained that I had a rattle under the hood. They immediately noticed that a couple of aluminum plates on the fire wall were overlapping and fixed it for free, on the spot. I had also pointed out to Sterling that the engine had a shake it did not have before the accident. Again, I was told this was normal and it would probably smooth out over time. I took the car to my mechanic who discovered a hairline crack in a motor mount. After several weeks of going back and forth with Sterling, my insurance company, and my mechanic the car is now fixed and running great. Dealing with Sterling was extremely frustrating and I would not recommend them to anyone I care about. They dismissed my concerns as being too critical. I had to take my vehicle to two other shops in order to get my vehicle running the way it should have the first time I picked it up from Sterling.",Negative
"About a month ago my Car got wrecked in an accident that wasn't my fault. even though the other drivers insurance takes care of repairs and a rental car. It's still very upsetting to be without your car for an extended period of time. A friend recommended that I take my car to Sterling for the repairs. Sterling was completely professional, gave me nearly daily updates via text, and called me multiple times each week to update me on the status of my repairs. When all was said and done, the repairs were completed nearly a week early. When I went to pick up my car, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, explained what was repaired, handed me some paperwork and my keys and I was on my way and back to normal. utter professionalism and quality service.",Positive
"We just used this service for the first time in about 10 years, and it appears that the owners have changed since the last time we used them. The employees were great - very friendly. And the shuttle service was very fast - which is exactly what you want to see, after you come home from a really long flight. Something I didn't like was that they insist that everybody really pack their cars in pretty close to each other, so it felt a bit scary driving around the lot to get to the self-park spot, it felt a bit uncomfortably close to have the car so near the neighboring cars. And then when we came back, there were cars double-parked behind ours that needed to be moved before we could go home. I still think this place is better than the Park N Fly value lot - just because the Park N Fly value lot has poor shuttle service, even though their actual parking spaces were nice and wide. Also with this place, there's an attendant who helps with payment up front, so then you can just go home when you come back. In sum, I have mixed feelings about this place - we may still use it again, because it's got a great price. It wasn't without it's drawbacks though.",Positive
"I've been paying $30 a visit (morning-night) at the Airport Daily Park the last few times I've flown (day trips), and finally got sick of it. Its clearly too much, as demonstrated by the fact that the lot is really empty. As I'm pretty pedantic about my car (I'm the guy who always parks on the far side of the parking lot to avoid dings), I did plenty of research, and decided on this place. I had seen some reviews of Park and Fly that mentioned a long wait for shuttle to airport. I also considered ""Skypark"", but read some horror story reviews on Google about the valets putting dozens of kilometers on the car; and multiple complaints of car damage. Decided to give this place a try for a one night trip. Cost me $24 (with tax) for 2 days of parking. Pros: -price (I believe this is one of the cheapest options) -shuttle picks you up and drops you right at your car -I may have got lucky, but minimal waiting time for shuttle Cons: -the shuttle is on the small side. It has 3 rows behind the driver. Each time it was full, so some people had to crawl to the back, which was pretty difficult. -the lots are not covered, nor are they paved. Also, there is minimal lighting, which could be a security issue. I got lucky because the main lot was actually full, so I got to park at the paved overflow lot across the street -the overflow lot across the street did have some ice on the parking spot positions. I had to be really careful when I got out of the car. I will use again.",Positive
Can't think of anything they can really improve on since it was really the great. Booked in advance and got a great rate. Arrived and you need to stop at the office to pay first. After paying and getting a ticket u wait in the car until a shuttle comes to guide u to a parking spot. Then u can get on the shuttle right away. Took 8 min to airport. Great free day staff. My flight was delayed and arrival time was an hour late than specified when I booked but not hassles and didn't charge me extra. Called them after passing customs and waited outside. They came within 10 minutes. Great service but the lot is unpaved. Tipped them nicely for the great experience. Will definitely go to them again.,Positive
"I have used this service several times. It's much cheaper than the main airport parking and the service is great. Every time I have been here, the staff have been incredibly courteous and helpful. Will totally use them again!",Positive
Yeah we loved this place! The guys are awesome and a great deal. They took us right to our car. I did not upgrade to the valet service - did not want to leave my keys. They drove me back to my parking space both times anyway. Would use again. No problems with car.,Positive
"Just got back from a trip and using Skyway Park. Used their online reservation system which was easy to use (I reserved just before i left the house). Service was friendly at the lot, and very quick. Shuttle led us to a parking spot, and waited for us to get out of the car and driver helped us load gear into the shuttle. Ride was about 5 minutes (closer than Park and Fly economy). Shuttle was nothing special, but clean and I wasn't concerned about it falling apart - pretty much all i need for such a short ride. On return, just called the number and someone came to pick up within minutes. Drove us right to the car and ensured we could start the car. The lot is unpaved so a bit bumpy, but its not in terrible shape, and no worse than other paved lots that are full of potholes. Overall, was very happy with the lot given the service and a very good price ($45 after tax) and I'd definitely use them again. edit: I'd recommend using their online reservation system because I believe it is cheaper than their regular posted rates on drive up. It's free and they don't charge you until you get there anyway.",Positive
"We got back after a major snow storm. The driver was nice enough to lend us a brush to clear our car and he also waited to make sure that our car started. I've parked here a few times because it's great value, it's close enough to Pearson (5-10 mins) and we don't have to wait too long for it to pick us up after we collect our bags (5-10 mins at a specific pillar). I'll continue to use them.",Positive
"We recently used Skyway Park when flying out of Pearson for a vacation. We'd be gone for 8 days and needed an affordable and secure place to keep the car when we where gone. It was super easy and convenient! You can complete the reservation online, give them your departure and arrival times and done. They have a little shuttle that will pick you up right at your car in their parking lot (super convenient when you are wearing sandals and summer clothes so you don't roast when you get off the plane in the tropics, but it just decided to finally snow the night of your departure) and take you to your terminal for check-in. Same deal coming back. We gave them a call once we were through customs and they were right there when we got outside. No waiting! I was amazed. Bonus points for the shuttle guy who gave us a boost when our battery had died over the week we were gone!",Positive
"I had the displeasure of meeting one of Steve's employees (although he was driving a truck that said Maple Roadside Assistance), and got a first hand look at this company's horrible customer service and incompetence. Reading some of the other reviews, it seems many of the employees, and perhaps the owner himself, may have a disregard for other people's time and safety. The employee, a young South Asian guy whose name I did not get, was feebly trying to hook up his tow to a SUV in an apartment complex parking lot. He positioned his truck right in front of the driveway entrance in a way where no cars could pass by him. I give the guy a bit of slack, assuming that he would probably soon as he just needs to get the car hooked up. Nope. About 20-25 minutes later, me and about 7 other cars are still waiting in our running cars while this bozo takes his time to do something I assume an actual trained professional would have completed much sooner. He's walking back and forth literally trying to kick his towing equipment into place, with the car visibly wobbling at every moment. It's pretty clear at this point that this guy has no clue what he is doing, and/or he is using very cheap equipment. As annoyed as I was, I still ask the guy politely how much longer he will be. His response is that he will ""take as much time as he wants."" I point out to him that here are 8 cars waiting for him to move, in which he yells that he ""doesn't care!"" After I ask the guy what his name is, he yells ""Asshole!"" Dude, I asked you what your name is, not what you are. Anyway, the guy turns around, and he's wearing a vest that says Steve's Towing, so here we are... Use this towing company if you want to deal with rude employees who don't seem to know how to actually tow cars.",Negative
"Wow, worst customer service in a company I've ever seen. Steve is a complete jerk for absolutely no reason. They run a very unethical practice and overcharge people for services no other company would overcharge for. Cars are kept in bad condition, rest of staff is really rude as well. Steve himself is extremely arrogant, hard to deal with, and really rude. I was told one price by the towing guy and ended up having to pay almost $400 more. Worst experience of my life, they don't even deserve one star.",Negative
Horrible service bunch of crooks working this establishment including the owner and his posse of criminals. One of our trucks broke down on the 401 and we had already contacted the company we deal with for our towing and they were on the way. A tow truck driver named Diether pulled up behind our truck and contacted the OPP after we had told him we did not need his companies services as they have a horrible reputation in the trucking industry. The OPP works in cahoots with Steve's towing and gave them authority to tow us and charge us $6000 for a tow we would have paid $1500 for. Our truck was on the shoulder and out of the way of traffic. The tow truck we had contact arrived just as Steve's Towing started hooking up our truck. The OPP should look into their members who are being contacted directly by Steve's towing and vice versa. This is a ridiculous scam operation costing businesses and individuals thousands of dollars. I am willing to make an official police report after this incident. I am aware of three other companies who paid an extra $5000 when the OPP forced them to deal with Steve's Towing. Hopefully this review and our complaint does not go on dead ears as there should be criminal charges for those involved in this illegal operation.,Negative
Some jerked cut me off on the highway and I ended up hitting the guard rail. Dick! Shitty day to say the least. Tow truck from Steve's towing picked us up and it was as great of an experience as one could expect after getting into an accident. The woman who owned the place made us feel comfortable and took our mind off things. Got a us a comparable rental and the work was done pretty quick. Highly recommended and will be back for the rest of my repairs moving forward. Thanks Steve's!,Positive
"Provided great service...got into an accident on 427, tow truck lifted the car. Took it too steves auto collision, was provided a rental while my car got fixed.",Positive
Picked up me on 401 exiting to the DVP after someone rear ended me. They were super professional took me straight their own bodyshop and got me a rental car right away. The even fixed my windshield chip and detailed my car. Love them,Positive
"http://www.torontosun.com/2015/12/07/tow-truck-road-rage-caught-on-video watch the video--remember the owner of this business Steve Pillay claimed this after seeing it We did not do anything wrong ... It's not like he's trying to put anyone in danger."" You don't have to give your business to a company that clearly has no respect for you on the road",Negative
"Terrible. Unethical. Vultures. Got in to an accident on the 401 and they jumped on my vehicle. Took it to their shop. Even after my insurance company said they'll take over and even after I gave them my authorization to release the car to my insurance company, they refused. It wasn't until I physically went down there that they finally relented. Never had an experience like this before. If they tell you you have to sign something to release your car, ITS A LIE! Do NOT sign anything with these criminals. One star is too many.",Negative
"Another place i wish i could give zero stars too. Very overpriced services (hundreds for breaks) and they made me come back a few days later because it was very obvious they had forgotten to do something. They lies on the phone saying it is protocol to have cars come back a few days later to check on them...come on liars just be honest and admit you messed up. They are not transparent at all and maybe it is because I was a woman - hate to go there but you all totally lived up to the stereotype. I have way more respect for people who are honest not those who pull wool over eyes. When I asked what they were doing exactly they just brushed it off and didn't give me a breakdown. They seem like gal group of immature boys running a sham business. Thushan is the manger and not very good with people or transparency which is a huge shame. While taking more time out of a second day to come back and have then corrwct their own mistame I also heard Thushan ordering a part on the phone for my car so it's very obvious they over charge, do shoddy work and are dishonest....this just adds to the mechanic crook stereotype. Jiffy lube on hwy 7 will recommend this place but I highly suggest you do not. Message me and I will share a much better mechanic who is not a crook and treats people respectfully. I'll never give this place another cent or look.",Negative
"Took my car in for an oil change at IMechanic around the corner and they informed me that my front tires were bald (like down to the rim bald). He recommended that I immediately change my tires. Asked him for a referral but he didn't recommend anyone. Jumped on Google and called a couple of companies. None of them had my tires in stock (I drive a Smart car and it's hard to find what I needed)...until I got a hold of Superior. I arrived there at 11:30 and drove my car out at 4:15. Thankful I live close to walk home during the wait. All in all, great service, great prices. I will be back when duty calls.",Positive
"Bought a Groupon to get my car alligned. It was frustrating to get an appointment; called multiple times before getting an appointment. I showed up at the appointment to be told they couldn't do it at that time so we ended up waiting for over an hour. By the time the car was done, half of my day off was wasted. If you value your time, don't bother coming here.",Negative
Book an alignment over a month ago. Was told it would be an hour wait. 30 mins goes by just to be told they'll have to send it out. They took my car over to Markham Laidlaw Auto Centre where I had to wait another hour. I just wanted my car back but they kept saying it's in the rack.,Negative
"Had new tires installed, balance job was poor and the car would shake at highway speeds. I was out of town and couldn't bear the shaking anymore and haf the wheels rebalanced at a crappy tire of all places and the shaking went away.",Negative
"One of the best or the best shop in Markham! Staff is the reason why my family comes back for ""Superior"" service. Cost is very reasonable, options on parts are always given, waiting time is always informed and last but not least the mechanic will show you what needs to be done and why it's being done. I would definitely refer this shop among friends and family.",Positive
"Excellent place for tires and minor work. Had a set of tires installed by them and they had the best price in the GTA. When they were installed, alignment was extra but the adjustment was so minor that they didn't charge me for it. I've recommended a few people since and they've all gone there for tires or work and have been extremely satisfied. Mike is a stand-up guy - very honest and understanding. Not many business are like this anymore. Highly recommended.",Positive
"Nothing wrong here from my experiences. Got what i wanted, got cash back as well, standard gas station with a standard car wash.",Positive
"Usually they offer a good service in the car wash. Lately sucks! Even the supervisor. An Asian guy don't care about customer service. Today, after 20 minutes, nobody touch my car. I just left.",Negative
Went to Terrible Car Wash in the Drive thru on Charleston and Nellis. And when I came out and parked to Dry my Truck off and Noticed scratches form the Brushes deep and long scratches on both sides of my truck. I did a report. And the following day they called me. So I drove my Truck for the management to look at and he said oh no that didn't happen at my Car Wash. So now I'm fighting them through my insurance company. And that the only car wash I go to. Because it's close to the house. So if you go through there car washes be sure to take a picture before you go through. Because they will denie you claim and damage.,Negative
It lives up to its name. TERRIBLE! I paid $17 for the wash and the main purpose was to have the interior windows cleaned. After tipping $5 and pulled off neither the front nor the rear windows were touched. I had to go back and get them to redo it. I will never go there again.,Negative
"Not recommended. Dirt still remained inside and out. I have a white car, very easy to see where they missed, but apparently they just don't care. I give every business two chances, second try was worse than first. I wish you luck if you take your chances.",Negative
"I like that this station isn't busy. And the attendants are nice. The $8 car wash is soso but then again it's just $8. I should've gotten the more expensive wash but I was in a rush, next time. They have monthly deals for washes and you could bring your car in everyday! :P for $15/$30/$50",Positive
"It still truly amazes me with people who hold a manager title that have a complete lack of knowledge when it comes to customer service. The wash machine malfunctioned on my car. There was a really long line of cars so somewhat understandable that they couldn't get my car back in the line and I was in a rush. When the manager Daniel finally came out to talk to me the most important words in the customer service language ""I'm sorry"" never left his mouth. Thankfully the guy who was responsible for wiping down my car made up for it but still ended up driving away frustrated.",Negative
$31 plus $5 tip and nothing was cleaned on the inside and outside was only partialy cleaned. I would not use this place in the future. I can get the same results at a $5 car wash.,Negative
Best car wash in the city. Matt the manager and Daniel Asst manager are so amazing when it comes to my car and truck. Always making sure they look their best when I leave. Would recommend to everyone. Stop in and check them out.,Positive
"I started coming here about a year ago. The car washes were always great and I never had any issues. The last time I came here in December, they could have done a better job vacuuming and the steering wheel area was not dusted. I let it go, everyone has bad days. However, when I returned yesterday and paid $31 for the Gold Mine wash, I am extremely disappointed. My routine is to get my car wash and then head next door to the nail salon. Unfortunately, I did not notice the issues until I had gotten out of the nail salon and by that time the car wash was closed. The windshield was not wiped down at all; the entire dash board was not dusted and the tires left much to be desired. I have also contacted corporate and am looking forward to a response to mediate this situation. If you still choose to get your car wash here, I'd highly recommend examining the car before taking off. Update: I reached out via Corporate and Asst. Manager Daniel responded within a few hours. I went in yesterday to have it redone and they did a great job round two and apologized for the inconvenience.",Negative
"Would not recommend. Car wash scratched the trunk of my car during my first visit. When I showed the brush scratches to the attendant he said ""This car wash cannot scratch your car. It's impossible."" When I told him that my car was in perfect condition when I brought it in. He said, ""If the car wash scratched your car, it wouldn't happen in that spot."" Ok, so which is it? Will not return.",Negative
"One of my favorite places to get a car wash here in town. There's really not much good car wash places here in town, unfortunately, but for budget prices it's hard to beat Terrible Herbst Car Wash in Southern Highlands. I went and received their high-end car wash, which was about $31. You go through an automatic wash, but not before they scrub down your grill and wheels. Afterwards, your car goes through an automatic dryer and depending on what service you get, your vehicle gets cleaned (exterior and/or interior) by one of the many friendly staff-members. They took quite some time, about 25 minutes, to get my car ""quick-detailed"". But that's alright -- I don't think car washes should ever be rushed, especially if you're expecting things nice and tidy. When he was finished, I inspected my vehicle and I would say I was about 90% satisfied. The front and driver's side window had a few dirt marks that I eventually wiped off, although they should've taken care of this. Also, the rear view mirror still had liquid on it, and they didn't place the complimentary air freshener for me. Service-wise, I guess I could've given three stars. But I bumped up to four because it's a very affordable price and their top wash comes with a 5-day guarantee: bring it back within 5-days and they'll wash the car again, free of charge. This is an awesome guarantee to have, especially around now when the weather is unpredictable. No paperwork to show if you want to take advantage of this, as they registered your plate number upon entry. I'll come back again, for sure. I would say this is an ideal car wash to goto for your ""in-between"" washes. But don't expect your car to be fully detailed.",Positive
"From what I can find, this is the BEST carwash in Vegas. The take their time and pay attention to details. I have always been very happy with their washes.",Positive
"1 STAR ONLY BECAUSE I CANNOT GIVE THEM A ZERO! I leave my keys in the car in the ignition. This place takes my keys, pulls them out of the ignition for no reason and then smashes my wife's FOB to her car with the middle console (2 year old car). My car is finished and the wash guy hands me the keys and states he is sorry he broke my keys. I come to realize the top of the FOB is knocked off, the inside hidden key is missing, the ring to the key chain is broken, a plastic piece from the device is missing and now the key magically has been removed from off of the key chain! He told me he would get his supervisor Donnie Sinclair who immediately started on a rant how it was not their fault. The car wash boy said he placed the keys on the hood and looking there on the hood guess what we found? The broken plastic to the FOB! Still denying they did anything wrong I asked to have an incident report filled out. When asked where the key and metal casing was the boy stated he thought it was sucked into the vacuum. This is at roughly 3:30pm. The supervisor refused and kept trying to talk to me about how it was not their fault. He said he already magically reviewed the cameras and saw no liability. When asked if he could see INSIDE the vehicle he stated no but still insisted nothing happened. I pleaded to please just have an incident report done and to let me on my way because I had an appointment after and was washing the car for that purpose. He rambled on about how their was nothing he could do. Other people getting their car washed made comments what he was doing was not right. He went into his office and I followed begging to just get my incident report so I could leave. Then he lied about how the FOB would come out of his pocket and he was the owner of the location. After I checked him on the fact Terrible Herbst was the owner and directed him to do the right thing at 5pm, an hour and a half later he finally wrote up the incident and I walked out. My FOB is broken, the key was swallowed up in the vacuum and I had to purchase a new one. I called Terrible's corporate and they have not been in a hurry to do anything and are now not returning my calls. This is NOT how you do business. A warning for all who read this! Beware, this location lacks a moral compass and will not do right for its customers even when liability is certain. Had they left the key in the ignition and turned off the car this would not even be an issue. If not indemnified i will take these people to court for much more than my FOB. The best way a customer can show a company they disagree with their actions is to deny them patronage. I will not support a place that lacks the simple knowledge that customers are everything to a business and doing the right thing by them is an absolute necessity!",Negative
"Theresa is without a doubt the LAST person on earth who should ever be dealing with customers. Completely fucking RUDE- incompetent, and unaware of what's going on around her. Asked for her manager and she said ""I am store manager TRAINEE"" and when I mentioned calling corporate she told me they're just gonna blow it off and tell me exactly what she did. That's fine- hopefully they tell me a little more nice and respectful than she did! You know it's bad when you have to YELP a freaking gas station..",Negative
"Worst interior car wash I've ever paid for. Paid for the most expensive wash (30$), outside looks okay, but inside was barely cleaned. Still dusty, left a ton of garbage, worst vacuum job I've ever seen. Guy was proud he did it in 5 min, handed me the key and walked away before I could say anything. At this point, I wanted to explain the issues to him, but I'd be wasting my time lecturing a teenager that wouldn't care, and I was having a really good day. Next logical step is to ask the manager to have someone else clean it, but he was busy yelling at another customer because an employee broke his key fob, and the customer called the cops. So I decided to head home, get a new car wash tomorrow from a more reputable place, and cut my losses. By the way, this is my second time here, neither was a great experience, especially this one. I do not recommend going here, way too many other options to deal with this.",Negative
"I've had my car washed several times here. The first time there was a line left down the back of my truck that I pointed out to the guy, who proceeded to tell me it needed to be buffed out of the paint. When I got home I got it wiped off with a little elbow grease and a soft rag. The second time was excellent. Everything was clean and polished. Third time the outside was great, but the inside was spotty with some areas clearly missed. Today was great again, and the guy asked me to take a look to see if it was all to my satisfaction. Which it was. Today's experience was great and I hope they keep the quality consistent. The pricing is a bit high, but it also has to do with the neighborhood we're in I believe.ni used to go to the one by my work in Henderson and the prices were lower. Overall it's a good place, but make sure you are checking their work.",Positive
"This is probably the nicest, quietest, and cleanest convenience store around. The place is amazing! The staff is very friendly and the adjoining car wash is very nice and convenient. Being in Southern Highlands, it's also cool to watch the car wash workers work because they get a handful of exotic or luxury cars on a daily basis.",Positive
Excellent quick and friendly service. My car was filthy and they are really taking the time to clean it. Waiting area is nice and clean. Perfect neighborhood car wash. A couple of places to eat lunch are in the same center which makes the waiting game a lot easier. So glad I came here.,Positive
"Great easy convenient car wash, friendly, little on the expensive side but worth it. Be sure to print coupons from snwa website you get $2.00 off",Positive
"Fantastic service. Friendly employees. I go every week. Sometimes twice a week with the monthly pass. Totally worth the cost. If they miss something, which can happen, just tell them and they are happy to go thru the car with you.",Positive
"I went to this car wash because it was super close to my house and the reviews were great. I was willing to spend the money and splurge on a tip because my car needed a good bath. To my surprise, I was extremely disappointed. Here is why.... The exterior wash was great but a black mark was left uncleared on left rear panel. The worse was the interior.... The trunk was left un vacuumed. There was dust still left under door handles, cup holder, and on top of right side of dash. I paid for the most expensive wash and come to find the interior was not even cleaned for what I paid for. I even gave the guy a tip on top of the cost. I have gone elsewhere for less with a better job than what they did today. I don't think I'll be back unless I decide to clean my own interior. People were nice, exterior wash was good, interior clean was horrible and for that..... Very over priced.",Negative
"Outstanding service and the guys and girls at the car wash are the best. I purchased the monthly unlimited pass and it was worth it weight in gold. No scratches, markings or anything else like most other car washes. These guys actually seem to care about the job they do!",Positive
Worst car wash ever. Now we know why it is called Terribles. A couple of lazy guys with a hose dousing every few cars when they're not on their cell phones. A drive through car wash with very little soap that left the car a dirty sticky mess that we had to go wash elsewhere. Waste of money and time.,Negative
"I purchased the monthly car wash and have now been here twice. The first time I left a little disappointed, there were smudge marks all over my windows that I didn't catch til I had already left. The second time I came, I made sure to let them know to clean the inside of the Windows. This time around, they did a better job. The one thing I noticed both times is, there's this male employee that seriously doesn't look like he works. I see everyone working and he's ALWAYS on the side, in the shade either rapping or on his phone. Sucks to be busting your ass and see your coworker doing nothing but getting paid the same!",Positive
"This place gets really good buisness. Everytime I drive by they are always busy and I notice there's a lot of nice cars getting serviced as well so I thought I'd give it a try. I signed up for a monthly membership which is unlimited washes and full service. I've been here five times now and my car is never spotless. Having a black car you can notice everything. I can still see the product they use and the streaks left behind. They tell me my car's ready, I'm in my car and they are still whiping it. I wish they would just take their time. When I'm home I just take a wet and dry towel to tidy up and my car looks brand new. The price is excellent, two minutes from my house and such an fast process.",Positive
The station in general is very clean and welcoming. Car wash is inexpensive and they do a great job of care for your vehicle.,Positive
"This Little Hidden Gem is Located in the Southern Highlands area of Las Vegas, and is Situated in the Middle of Perks Cafe, 8th Avenue Pizza, and Capriotti's also in the area. This is a New Location, So not Everyone know about this place...Until Now, lol! This is your Typical Gas and Go Convenience Store, with Friendly Staff...but they do have a Car Wash. They do have Car Wash Specials ( ask inside for more details) Love this Place...Good Location, Friendly Staff, and a Car Wash? I'm Always filling up my Baby here!! =)",Positive
"Wonderful spot! Great service, good price at 29.00 plus get another car wash within five days for free! Only one thing I would like differently SHADE STRUCTURE for the people waiting for a full service car wash. Please please provide shade!",Positive
"Make sure you stop by and check out this brand new car wash. It's super fun and it does a great job! They have different colored bubbles and LED light effects which makes for a highly entertaining experience while doing something as mundane as going thru a drive-thru car wash. The manager told me there's only two of these type of car washes in the entire country so it's probably not like something you've seen before. They offer unlimited car washes for $15.99 a month for the exterior option, $29.99 for full service and $49.99 for supreme full service and you can go to any of the Terrible's car washes in town. It's a good deal. I'm definitely signing up.",Positive
I really HATE this place I've been living in the area for about 4 years and was so happy they gave us a convenience store that we didn't have to go all the way to Durango. But they SUCK howwwwww is the line always super long howwwwww do you not have change? How does the chick take a sip AND THEN start to ring people up when the line is all the way down the aisle. The employees get a F for effort except for the newest black guy he's cools everyone else is lazy and i get better service from a 711 and that's saying a lot,Negative
"Quite disappointed with the car wash. I like that the system is a touch free car wash, however I notice that it does not clean the car as well as other places in the area that uses different methods of brush free/touch free wash. I had to go elsewhere for a rewash. The windshield came out very spotty and there was a bit of spotting. I typically might not mind the windshield since I can do it myself, but the spotting on the body was particularly bad. I was getting the car ready for a show and it was very noticeable.",Negative
"This store just opened in May, 2017, and it is wonderful! Being new, it's certainly clean and well-stocked. It has a very nice selection of beverages including a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine (the big, red one with multiple brands and flavors.. Tip: Use the app to make your own mixes!). The car wash is a simple drive-thru. The gas pumps are not plain: They're the first I've ever seen that take Apple Pay! (Or Google/Samsung) How convenient! The police say using those options are much safer, especially since you don't have to pull your wallet out now. Apple Pay at the pump is incredulous, but prices are not as low as Sam's Club. Actually 30¢ higher! There are several selections of hot food items such as hot dogs and taquito type roll ups (Tornado brand), as well as nacho cheese and chili to apply. Really, the only negative I have seen, after several trips, is that they don't have the long, red, fat straws for drinks that 7-Eleven and even some other Terrible Herbst's have. That's a big, inconvenient disappointment, and one that will give me pause to come here for a fountain drink. Otherwise, I'll be back! Update: January, 2018 This store is failing. They still do not have any form of ice tea, whether at the Freestyle machine or the Gold Leaf dispenser other Terrible Herbst's have, still no fat straws, and perhaps most importantly, their cold beverage shelves are empty on a weekday morning (BEFORE the rush!). The store remains very clean, and Apple Pay is a huge plus, but a clean store with amazing payment options didn't mean much if you don't have the right things to buy. Very disappointing..",Positive
"Since opening date of this place I'm there. I was always going for the drinks coz I find that this is closest place that offers cold drinks (soda) in zero calories that you mix . Today cashier Juana gave me a very bad customer service, 1st she asked for my day and I said it's fine then she sarcastically said oh just ok, I kept my cool coz it's still early, so I smiled and continues to smile but again with sarcasm she said don't be so cheerful, then she asked me if want my receipt and I said yes, again with sarcasm you don't need this. She should not be working the counter if she's this rude to customers. Management should look in to this. I would if I'm the manager of this business. Poor training. I'm so disappointed. If there's a rating that's is no star I will give this place a zero. I'm not coming back.",Negative
"Absolutely the most frustrating ""convenience"" store. ALWAYS a line never not once were they staffed properly!! Today was my last time even bothering stopping. I get it if it was once in a while but it is every single time.",Negative
Car wash has literally broken while my vehicle has been inside twice and once whole waiting on the car in front of me. Customer service is terrible too. Guess the name fits.,Negative
"I walked into this Cheveron to grab a few things, I had my dog in my arms. The staff was amazing, with a quick and friendly check out and even gave my puppy a treat! Thank you! Wish I would have gotten names, but we will be back!",Positive
"8/25 Friday Night...9:50pm Absolutely terrible service! Went in for a couple drinks and there was 1 male cashier with 10 people in line. Once someone decided to come up and help they had the other cashier close with a very long line. I get breaks or shift changes, but at least get the line down first. In addition, the girl that came up was a tall darker skinned girl in a red shirt followed by a shorter girl in a blue shirt that was observing from behind. While ringing up customers they were chit chatting about their lives and the 3 jobs the one girl has, in the mean time we are all waiting in line having to listen to it!! For the area this gas station is in, I would expect a much higher level of service and gratitude toward the customers! I didn't even get a smile or a thank you! Won't be back, which sucks because I live up the street! Rather go to Freddy's! At least they tell me to have a fabulous day!",Negative
Filled up and requested car wash but no receipt printed and was advised to go in to get my receipt. This was a real inconvenience due to having kids in my car. Left without going in. Keep your receipt paper filled at the pumps!!!,Negative
"Great service! Great staff! Kerry was amazing at finding the problem with my brakes. With each vehicle, I can image it'd be difficult to pin point the problem. Kerry was attentive to what could be causing the noise on seemingly good brake pads and rotors. I appreciate his professionalism and knowledge. I'll definitely come back for any of my car's needs. And I highly recommend. Thank you!",Positive
"Left my car to be cleaned and a huge scratch appeared in my panel. Manager joe was rude and didn't even try to help me. Terrible service, rude manager and now I gotta go talk with my insurance company.",Negative
"Took my car in today to terrible Herbst to get it cleaned. Paid for a sheriff wash and got my car back looking worst than how it was. How is that possible?!I'm honestly so disappointed in this place. I called to talk to some about my service and I got the manager JOE, I was very pleasant and let him know that my car was not cleaned very well on the inside. When looking further, my car had not been touched at all on the inside. I let the manager JOE know and his response was and I quote "" I know who worked on your vehicle and he's old... he's on the verge of retirement and WE'RE trying to get him out of here.... Right before hanging up the phone on me. How do you talk about an employee like that? How do you treat your customers like that? Don't make excuses make it right. Like I said before I'm not angry but disappointed that I PAID for a services and was treated like I was asking for a favor.",Negative
The worst car wash and even worse manager I ever experienced today. $15 just for exterior and they don't even dry your car. Manager said that's how it is on the west coast however the Green Calley car wash people charge $8 for exterior and at least offer to dry your car. Never Again!,Negative
"Awesome service... Honest and helpful people... After I found these mechanics and lube shop 9 yrs ago, I send all my friends and family to Kerry, Marcos, Eric and the staff.",Positive
Stopped to buy cigarettes for the first time. The cashier asked for my ID. There is no way in the world I look under 21 years old and no need to hand her my driving license. This asinine rule is ridiculous when a person is clearly looks older than the legal age limit!!!! Never will I step foot on their property again!,Negative
"I wish there was a way to give this location a negative zero for their service (or the lack thereof) today. My mother made an appointment to get her car serviced. It was an 8a appt in which she even arrived early for. Marcos and Erick, who I thought would take of my mother's auto needs, dropped the ball so hard that it must have cleared 8ft down. They told her it was only for a diagnostic; shouldn't take too long. We'll give you a holler soon, they said. Nothing all day; no communication whatsoever from them. We called in the evening, spoke to another Eric (""the diagnoser"") and they hadn't even diagnosed the car. We had to go up to the garage and just pick up the car. Oh, finally Darryl did call us back an hour after our call. The excuse they gave us for the lack of communication was that Marcos went to school. They made us feel unimportant and they didn't apologize.",Negative
"Very simple... took my car because I hear a rattle noise thinking that it was the ""converter"". After the friendly staff checked my car. They told me that all it was a bold missing. Which I appreciated the honest friendly and helpful service. They did not charged me at all. Again ""HONEST SERVICE"" and yes I will recommend this location to all my friends. Keep the honestly",Positive
"First off I fired the terrible herbs team on trop and topaz. I never left that place with the same amount of bolts in my skid guard and I never saw the same employee twice... the Annie Oakley crew is top notch they focus on their job at hand and I didn't see any employees wander over to talk about Saturday nite while someone was work under my flawless 4runner!! I really like these guys, I know it's not rocket science but these guys do a great job and you don't have to worry about your vehicle in their hands!",Positive
Great customer service. Always friendly. The store is clean. They always discuss charges and recommendations prior to performing. Very good experience,Positive
"Very fast & professional service - Terrible's on Sunset/Annie Oakley Oil change was $49.99 and they gave me a free car wash as they do with every oil change. I also told them I had a check engine light on and they quickly diagnosed the problem. Then they came inside and told me what was wrong with my car, and fixed it for absolutely nothing. It was FREE! It wasn't something worth charging me for anyway as the problem seemed to be some lose screws connected to the gas pedal. They quickly fixed the problem and came in the waiting room and explained to me what had happened. I appreciate their courtesy as others would try to charge someone just to make an easy buck for something like that. I recommend this location to anyone who needs a quick oil change, tune up, has a problem with their vehicle, or simply wants a car wash. Everyone is friendly, smart, and professional.",Positive
"Just brought in 2 cars for oil changes. They were fast, cordial, and economical if u factor in the full service car wash and even a free drink. My new favorite place for oil changes!",Positive
"I came in for an oil change early Friday morning. There were so many cars that were being worked on in the Self-cleaning areas that I almost didn't stop in for my service. However, I was greeted right away once I pulled up. They had my oil change dine in about 30-40 min! It's been a few months since my last service so there were a few new faces. They all had nice and welcoming attitudes. The best part about getting my oil change here is the free car wash after. I didn't do a full car wash this time since I was on a hurry, but the free car wash covers an exterior wash and a basic exterior/interior wash.",Positive
Manager was a complete a****** my car got scratched out my mirror got nothing on the machine no apologies just complete room that never go there.,Negative
"Truly lives up to the name ""terrible"" . $30 for a dry wipe across the dash. The only thing that kept this from 1 star is the outside looked nice. Besides that, the cup holder was sticky, debris still on the vents and seats... I asked for my money back. The assistant manager offered for it to be redone, but it could have easily been done right the FIRST time (since I was the only car in the place) --so I declined. I will do a better job with my eyes closed.",Negative
"I highly recommend going here for all your auto needs- maintenance, repairs, whatever! The manager Kerry won't bullshit you and try to squeeze your wallet dry... And this is so nice because I'm a woman who knows nothing about cars or cost of repairs! I originally took my car to Carmax because my check engine light had come on. They wanted to charge me almost $200 just for labor and a diagnostic check!!! And I have an extended warranty! So I took it to Kerry, and he did it all for free! Which is what I thought most places do for diagnostic checks. It turned out to basically be a computer glitch within my system- which he fixed still with no charge. I will never go anywhere or see anyone else again as long as he is around! Amazing customer service!",Positive
"I ALWAYS come here with my car wash voucher after getting my oil changed at the location on Eastern & Serene. They sure are great at what they do, quick and effective! Nothing like a full service hand wash.",Positive
Best people ever! My car didn't pass smog but they gave me a free quote to fix it within 20 minutes. I took it to 2 other places for estimates and their price was by far the lowest! I really appreciate their honesty and making this a pleasant experience!,Positive
"Idiots. Make sure you get what you pay. I have the month plan and they give me the chip wash, I have to ask for a towel to dry car.on top of that there is no urge for good service, like ignoring you or don't want to work. Do they want business?",Negative
Never an issue with the oil change guys but once again a service issue with the idiots at the carwash. The manager Jerry felt that they had no responsibilities in a paint chip that did not exist before I brought my car in for a wash. This is now the second time they have done something to a vehicle. Shame on me for even returning and giving them a second chance. Complete asshole and completely unprofessional as a manager. Was more worried about throwing his chest out and trying to pretend to be a tough guy at all 5 foot 6 instead of taking care of something responsibly. Guess there's a reason he's my bitch and I pay people like him to do things.,Negative
Quick and friendly service. Andrew knows what he is talking about and is really concerned for the well being of the customers and their cars!,Positive
"I drive all the way from Silverado Ranch to this location for full service car washes. There is also a self service wash and an oil change facility on the property, and gas pumps and convenience store too. Pretty much everything you could need car wise and their employees have always been pleasant.",Positive
I usually love this place but today I had bad service. The workers and manager were more interested in talking than working and as a result my car took forever while other vehicles came later and were out sooner. When I mentioned it to the manager he made an excuse and did not care. But he was the one yapping and keeping my technician distracted.,Negative
"I've been taking my car to this location for oil changes for years. I've always appreciated their efficiency and honesty. Today, I learned that they offer many more services. I was able to have my brakes (pads and shoes) replaced at this location.. They have extremely reasonable rates (the best rate out of the 5 shops that I called). I recommend this location for anyone who needs work done on their cars. They are friendly, honest, and skilled mechanics.",Positive
Always get great service and they're pretty fast (faster than Jiffy Lube). Pricing is the same as the rest of the industry.,Positive
"The low grade is for the self service car wash. Nothing to do with the lube, but there was no option for the self serve. Major beefs: no tire cleaner, cold wash water and very little soap. I thought this may be a problem specific to the location at Nellis and Charleston, so I chose to give them another chance. Nope...just as bad here in Green Valley. I don't recommend using Terribles for self service car washing unless the above beefs don't bother you.",Negative
I came here to get my car washed and I had no idea what I was doing. Everyone I spoke to was so helpful and patient! My car is my baby and they took good care of her. :),Positive
"I took a chance and stopped here to get a quick oil change. I was pleasantly surprised. First, the entire process took less than 30 minutes from arrival. Second, the price was excellent. Third, you get a free car wash and fountain drinks/coffee just for purchasing an oil change. My service was done by Kerry, and I cannot recommend him enough. He was nice, knowledgeable, and didn't find things ""wrong"" with my car like other places tend to. Great experience all around!",Positive
"He sold my car on consignment, and made excuse after excuse about paying me. Finally gave me 2 checks one was bad. Still owes me $3500.00 and said I have to sue him for the rest. He used my money to fund his store instead of paying me. This has been going on since my daughter was in the womb, she is now 15 months old. WAYNE U ARE A THIEF!!! You stole from my little girl and my family.",Negative
"I ordered a set of Hood Pads for a Rolls, No response for over two weeks, I called to find out if it was shipped ""Wayne"" said it was going out the door today which was last Tuesday, Few more days go by still no word. Call again they did not have it in stock, so they are going to make a set.. This is after I already mailed by hood pads as cores. Now three weeks have gone by, I requested a refund and return of my hood pads. No response other than to say would process refund on Monday 5/1/2017 as they credit card system is down for weekend. Today I called and reported the fraud to the credit card company,so at least I will get my money back there. My factory Hood Pads are worth $1000.00 so I filled a police report for grand theft..Thank god I shipped with fedex and received confirmation they received them. So let me break down the scam. You order a part, most parts he is charging a core charge. You pay the core charge or ship your part in. He has no intention of shipping any parts, so the list of excuses start, then a few weeks go by and you forget, which allows your own credit card company to question,why you did not report the loss sooner. Fortunately this appears to be a pattern, so the Las Vegas PD was very willing to take a police report without me being there and they also suggested I make a police report to my local police department which I did.. Bottom line, people like this is why honest mechanics get such a bad reputation..... Order anything from this guy at your own peril. Good thing is I have to trailer my Porsche to Pebble Beach in August, I'm going to stop in there and get see the thief personally. 0 star= thief, liar & crook 1 star= the website from which he steals look very legit any positive reviews are from the crooks that work there, or people actively involved in helping him run his Ponzi Auto shop The Touring Shoppe actually means ""THE PONZI SHOPPE"" your money and parts go in and never return. Big thank you to LAS VEGAS PD and Delray Beach PD, awesome community relations and attention to detail",Negative
"If I knew then, what I know now, I would steer clear of this thieving shop. The owner broke our contract & still owes us $15,000.00 for a car he never completed work on or delivered. He's more interested in taking your money then completing the work he contracted for. I wonder how many more people will take him to court? We signed a contract on 2/14/14 & he said the car would be completed & restored in a few months. He kept stalling & stalling & complaining about his lack of help & that he has no good mechanic s, etc. We kept asking him when the car would be done & the last e-mail we received from him was full of foul language & then he closed his e-mail account so we could not contact him. He never tried to contact us again & it's been over two years. DON'T EVER TRUST THIS GUY...EVER!!!",Negative
"Once again, the Touring Shoppe has saved the day for me! Fuel pump failed and he found a NOS pump at a great price! Created a bracket, cleaned my carbs! He knew exactly what the issue was before my car arrived. Can't go wrong here! Another loyal customer!",Positive
I've had the misfortune to enter and give this creep my Rolls Royce .He promised he would perform minor repairs in less than a week .I waited more than two weeks and he hadn't even touched the car.As a matter of fact my car was covered with soot and dirt from a Tractor equipment playground next door to this repair facility.My doors were even ajar open and car Paint was filthy.Stay Away unless your ready to get a Buffalo snow job.Regards Astute Consumer B.Norton.(Below N.),Negative
The only shop I would trust with a Rolls Royce!!! The owner is very knowledgable and the garage is prepared to do all kinds of work to these classic cars.,Positive
Short staffed. Hard working people in this busy shop. But you have to arm yourself with patience. Stress and overwork leads to interrupted and incomplete communicational thus ending up in several calls and rude interventions to achieve your goals.,Positive
Thanks to the owner for all the help and recommendations. I'm in Orlando. He's in NV. Still worth the effort. As he rebuilds accumulators in a frequent basis I think this makes a difference. The accumulators in my Rolls worked beautiful and have had no issues with them. Also at a fair price.,Positive
"Just called this shop up with a general engine question on a classic I was working on. The very rude person on the phone there said ""I don't think so"" and HUNG up on me. RUDE! What makes you think with this attitude on the phone, one would be dumb enough to bring in a classic vehicle (they specialize in Rolls Royce and Bentleys) to have restoration work done on! Guess what The Touring Shoppe??? As far as my monies and vehicles brought here.... You guessed it ""I don't think so"" EITHER!",Negative
"This place needs to be shut down. Can't run a business. Employees are incompetent, kinda like they're just there for you to look at. Good for nothing, and Very unhelpful and very unhappy.",Negative
"Used slurs, rude. This place is so hostile. My car had a flat and was towed from the location I had it parked in (my fault, not theirs). I called over the weekend to see about picking it up, they said they would charge me even more if I tried to pick up on a Sunday, so I went in on Monday. They still charged me 3 times as much as any other impound I had been to before. I paid without any scene or argument, the bald man said he would drive the car around and I could go. Waited for a few minutes, the same guy came outside and said he left my key in my car so I could drive up. As i walked up to the car another guy started screaming at me to get off the lot, I calmly explained the bald guy had told me to drive away with it. I pulled out a can of fix a flat to try and re-inflate the tire of the car so I could drive it off the lot. At which point the bald guy starts screaming at me, to get off the lot. I said ""Im trying to but this tire is flat, I just need to put this fix a flat in"" to which he yelled ""Thats not my problem! Get the f$%k off the lot!"", I again stated calmly ""Im trying to, I hear you"" to which he is says ""I Dont think you do understand. Stupid f@ggot"". I then had to drive my scraping rim out of the lot while they continued to shout at me."" I understand this is an impound lot, but a trace amount of human civility and empathy is not too much to ask. Don't support this company if you can avoid it.",Negative
This company has to be one of the worst managed tow companies I have ever seen. Most tow places are pretty similar but these guys hold the crown for worst. Terrible customer service and a laundry list of how not to run a business. I feel sorry for anyone who deals with them.,Negative
"If you can avoid this place, don't deal with them at all. Their customer service is terrible. I spoke with a gentleman(Julio) and before I could even get a word in he gave me attitude about what he was going to do and not do. I called about paying for and picking up a tow today and they refuse to let us pay for it and let the car go. Keeping the car for another day and incurring more fees. Told me he didn't have time to deal with this he has other things to do. If they are short staff then that is not my problem. We just wanted to pay and get the car out the impound lot as the car was disabled and we had a tow on the way to come get the car.",Negative
Great place for car actions good deals and excellent customer care service. You can find all sort of cars including classic cars you won't find anywhere in those prices and deals. Definitely recommend to check them out you won't be disappointed.,Positive
This place is great has great deals and it's a lot of fun I'm telling all my friends and coworkers this place is awesome!!! I never ever leave reviews but I had such a great experience I just had to!!!!! The people are so nice and very informative.,Positive
They are the most rudest most unprofessional sorry so and so's I have ever dealt with. They are industrial pirates that need to be shut down. They actually enjoy watching the misery of others.,Negative
"Rude! Happened to find a receipt from the nightmare we experienced with this towing company and I had not had a chance to write a review about it. This actually happened about 2-1/2 years ago during one of our weekend getaways in Las Vegas. We parked at the lot that was adjacent to (at the time) The Riviera on Las Vegas Boulevard South. There were two other cars there so we thought it was safe. It was around 9:00p at night. Wanted to see if the Groupon we purchased for the show Illusions, featuring German Illusionist Jan Rouven, could be redeemed even though the deal was purchased while the show was still at the Clarion on Convention Center. Las Vegas Strip changes so much, both casinos have gone bankrupt since and are no longer there. Illusions is now showing at the Tropicana. Sorry, I digress.... We parked and ran inside The Riviera to inquire if we are still able to exchange the deal for tickets to the show but unfortunately we were not able to. We were only gone for 10 minutes since parking the car and we came back to a tow truck from this company with our car already hooked to his truck! That was the scariest thing I saw and experienced. Hubby and I pleaded with the tow operator to give us a break and we told him that we did not see any signs and that there were other cars parked on the lot too. It was dark and he pointed to an itty-bitty sign stating that the lot was a private lot. I practically begged the guy to not tow our car since we were already there to claim the car but he insisted on bringing it to their impound lot, plus we don't have $360+ in cash that he was asking to claim the car. He finally agreed to unhook the car after 15 minutes of trying to reason with him. He was asking for $153 cash. Had to run back inside Riviera Casino to get cash from an ATM machine. I was just glad that he agreed to give us back our car right there but the guy was still a jerk, rude and a scam. Now we get paranoid in parking in public areas like that... I think these people are just waiting for victims to prey on. We were only gone for 10 minutes (maybe even less), how could he have showed up there so fast. Review #0381",Negative
"WHY AM I ALWAYS DEALING WITH THESE AWFUL PEOPLE ? So not only do they make it hard to get my car because this place is TEN MILES AWAY FROM MY LIVING PLACE, I show up to the location and they moved. Okay so I completely missed a whole day of work because I had to keep calling this place at least 28 times to get someone to answer and it asks you for an extension or press 00, you press 00 and it just takes you on a loop. Okay so I show up to the place, the stupid whore on the phone didn't even have the decency to mention that they moved their location !!! You gave me a time limit to get my car but I show up to an empty lot and notes indicating at all where my car is. Okay I have to call them back AGAIN. This time it took 30 more times to get someone to answer the phone and they give me the address : 1414 industrial road (which is an awful area)",Negative
"These jerks towed my car last night purely because I have Alaska tags. I am new here so they haven't bern changed. There was a 100 other cars in this lot with mo signage. They had my car for less than an hour and I waa charged $305. And the establishment looks like leather faces fortress. All of the people there are rude AF. I hope they get sued, shut down, and the disgusting establishment condemned",Negative
If you call them you will be met with nothing but rudeness and hostility. But if you show up in person and talk to the girl at the front desk you may be met with kindness and someone who wants to help you get your car back.,Negative
"Absolutely a scam and fraudulent company. They towed my car in front of my house without issuance of a violation sticker, and ignored my PARKING PERMIT. I have been parking in front of my house for ten years with no issues. They charged me $367 to get my stolen car removed from their hostage. Then when I tried to examine my vehicle the old white guy with a mustache who looks like a child molester told me ""do that shit outside I got work to do"". These people are the scum of the earth.",Negative
"I just witnessed these guys trolling my street and as soon as someone parked in front of their own house in the street they left a very hard to remove sticker on their window. One of these guys admitted to a friend of mine that they tow cars even in areas that are ""gray"" because they make extra money this way. I've seen these guys go above and beyond asshole status in the last year or so here in vegas. hope you feel so happy causing others b.s!",Negative
"Dispatcher was incredibly rude. But it's a tow company, no surprise there. Pulled up in our cab as the tow truck was pulling in with my car. Didn't even park my car on their lot and charged me $300!! What a scam!",Negative
Really???? I gota even give them 1 star? They do not know any laws...they don't take credit cards...this is illegal as of oct 1 2013....they said we couldn't get our car out at 9 at night...WRONG liars....they were suppose to make the towed car available to us in a timely maner...steer clear...and HOAS DONT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! THEY LIE...FLAT OUT LIE,Negative
These guys are a scam. They towed my car from down town. Charged $300+ to get it out even though it had been in tier possession for only 1 hour. While getting it back there were two others here that got towed from the same exact parking space. They have only one sign. It's almost on the roof that says no towing. Nothing else. It's an empty parking lot. See the pix,Negative
Do not use any of the services the are scam the have connection to the organize crime The tow away cars Illegally and no one can stop them doing that,Negative
Terrible service! The place is an absolute shit hole. These folks are flat out crooks. They towed my car after it broke down on the freeway back to their yard after I requested that it be taken to a local auto service. While in their possession a large scratch was made on the rear bumper and they refused to acknowledge it happened on their watch. SCAM ALERT!,Negative
"Todd redirected our car with transmission problems to a disreputable place because he couldn't find out what was wrong with it. We spent thousands and months trying to get it to run only to find out in the end it was a sensor. Still went back to him. The last time that we went there he had our car for over week. We couldn't get a hold of him and when we did he said that they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the car. A few days later he said that they were still trying to figure it out. We called again and he said that they couldn't find our car keys. We were very upset and went to talk with them about it but no one was there. We looked under the rock where we had left them because we had left it there when they were closed, and the keys were still there and had not ever been moved. He had not ever looked at our car and lied about the whole thing, keeping our car from us that whole time. We took the car without ever talking to him about it and he never called to tell us that it was missing. We took it next door to A and B motors and it was a simple problem and had it back in one day.",Negative
Excellent work by honest guys! Everyone needs a good mechanic you can trust. I've taken my Tahoe and every other vehicle to them for oil changes to ac repair and engine work,Positive
"When searching for someone to do body work on my husband's truck, we ran into Mr. Tullock at a local gas station. He saw the damage, walked up and introduced himself and gave us his business card. After looking online at the wonderful reviews, we decided to get a quote from Tullock. He beat out all the other prices that we had gotten, and with the assurance of wonderful online reviews we decided to go with him. He took the truck a few days later and had the body work done in about 6 days - really quick compared to other body shops we had dealt with in the past. The truck looked amazing after the body work, it was affordable, and it was done in a timely manner. We also had some brake work done while the body work was being done, and that went well. We definitely feel like Tullock Automotive is an honest, reputable place to take your vehicle and we will be continuing to service our cars with Tullock for years to come. Would definitely recommend them!",Positive
Todd is a great mechanic good person! His wife was so very nice I have told a lot of people about this place just because of his character! Thank you todd so very much as soon as I get my new hot rod its your to fix!,Positive
I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina!,Positive
"When my girlfriend and I moved from NY we had to find someone reliable and trustworthy to work on our vehicles. Tullock automotive has not disappointed us. Todd, his wife and the rest of his staff have been our go to for anything automotive while we have lived here. Their flexibility, honesty and friendliness are why we keep coming back. If you live in the area or not they are worth the drive to check them out. You will not be disappointed in the service. Tullock automotive is a great local business in Stallings. If you have vehicle issues do not hesitate to give them a call.",Positive
I was looking around for a place to take my car when I came across reading reviews about Tullock Automotive. Convinced by the reviews I decided to call in. All I can say was they were absolutely awesome and friendly. They were able to quickly diagnose the problem of my car and get it done. I now take my car to Tullock Automotive because I know that I won't get sucked in by some other places that overcharge and don't always do the best job. It has a very family oriented atmosphere with Todd's wife working there too. I totally agree with everyone's reviews that Todd and the guys at Tullock Automotive is the place to take your car. You WILL not be disappointed!! So happy that I found these reviews helpful!!! Highly recommended!!!,Positive
"After reading the reviews for Tullock Automotive and seeing it was just a few miles from my house, I took my SUV in for brakes and a gas smell. Sure glad I chose this place as I felt Todd and his staff were very honest and even took me back to show me where the gas smell was coming from. They had a new fuel pump and brakes put on my vehicle by the end of the day. Thank you so much, guys!",Positive
I can't believe how friendly and nice the mechanic named Todd was!! First time visiting there today had a alternator belt that squeals really loudly when I started up the car. Was quite embarrassing and annoying with this problem. So I decided to get it fixed and found this place on yelps with good reviews I had no choice but to go here since I stay down the road and the shop reviews was what I was looking for. Todd came to my assistance as I literally opened that door and took a few steps Into the lobby. Got my car done and right away in under 5 MINS!! Fixed the problem ALSO gave me a deal to help get my AC working when I decide to get it fixed. All I gotta say is I can highly recommend this place. Even though I only visited one time first impressions had me at awe. Ill definitely come back here again!! Hard to find good business like this place these days. Thanks! Randy.T,Positive
"I'm a car guy and I can spot a fellow car guy and that folks at Tullock are car guys. This family-owned shop is friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly honest. It's easy for mechanics to take advantage of customers that wouldn't know better. These guys don't do that at all. Plus, if you're info older and classic cars, they can do a restoration too. If you're looking for an honest mechanic to help your car last that much longer (as we all are), give Todd a call",Positive
Alejandro and his team did a great job. I always come here and will continue to. Everyone is always friendly and detailed.,Positive
They provide outstanding service with unbelievable attention to detail ensuring that no spots are missed on your vehicle. I take all of my vehicles there to be detailed with quality service and one of the very competitive prices.,Positive
"Great car wash!! Lamont and the whole crew do an AMAZING job!! Customer satisfaction is their main goal, it DEFINITELY shows in their work!!!",Positive
"Ok not the first time I've been here, but they dont even wipe off the dash or cup holders without you having to tell them, paid extra for vacuum of the seats and dash cover nope not done only heard excuses. WILL NOT come back I kept thinking try it again but after 3 times it's a full on strike out so f this place! Ps everyone here acts entitled, it's a job people do it!",Negative
"Horrible customer service! As I went to pay for my gas, I greeted the cashier with a hello and good morning, then proceeded to ask the cashier if the pumps were labeled in sequence. She rudely, with attitude said ""the pumps all have a number like a house number and normally customers come in knowing the number"". I was pretty shocked. She wasn't wearing a name tag so I don't know her name. Horrible customer service! However, the gentleman in charge of the car wash service was helpful, professional and went out of his way to walk me inside to show me car wash prices.",Negative
We get gas all the time and this morning I went over to fill up around 9.10 and it wouldn't take my card . I went inside to pay I don't do pins and I had a chip card the girl would not let me swipe it she was very rude i didn't get her name but I went to Smith's and filled up . I go to us gas cuz it's cheaper not anymore,Negative
"Great customer service! I went in for a car wash and was automatically greeted by the helpful staff. Not only did Gilbert and his wash team provide an awesome interior/exterior wash, they also recommended and repaired minor windshield damages. Awesome work! Thank you Gilbert and team!",Positive
"I came for a car wash and the manager Gilbert was super friendly . The car wash didn't take more than 20 minutes, considering how busy they were. After car wash, my battery went out and they gave me jump . So not only did my car look sparkling, they also helped me out in a difficult situation .",Positive
"Great gas prices, normally! great carwash, great convenient store, great customer service! Ask for Lamont at the carwash",Positive
"thanks to Gilbert the mng,an Dior for making my car look beautiful I like the details they put in goodplace to wash your car,check them out",Positive
"Love this place! Gilbert and his crew are awesome! Best carwash I've had in the Valley and trust me, I've been to a few... Thanks Guys!",Positive
Can't go wrong with US Gas on Centennial Parkway. Outstanding job as always thanks to the badass crew. Customer service is always great. Job is nicely done and quick. They take really good care of my car. Recommend these guys 100%!,Positive
"Cheap prices but horrible customer service. Danielle, the rude bitch at the counter needs a reality check. I didn't have an attitude with her but for some reason needed to have one with me. I should have spit in her face. But I didn't.",Negative
"If they don't try so hard to up sale you on stuff you didn't go ther for it would be a better experience I just wanted my truck washed, For The amount of people around they are pretty slow",Negative
"I have been going to ultimate for at least 6 years. I have recommended people to them in the past and when I had my car accident I wanted to go to them for my repairs. I ended up having to take my car back 4 times. I wanted it fixed so I didn't mind. Al at ultimate Collision ended up being very impatient and annoyed with me after our last conversation. Not only did he tell me that his last suggestion would have to be paid for out of pocket, he turned around and told the adjuster with my insurance company he never said such a thing. In the beginning I was very pleased with Al and Ultimate but after the exchange yesterday I am praying the repairs that I had thru them never have a problem in the future because I do not want to deal with someone that rude again.",Negative
"I am in shock right now. I have been taking my cars here for the last 5 years. April 29th I had a fender bender. Lee quoted me $10,464 in which my ins company totaled my car because my value is $9500. Well I have found out they find parts that are ridiculous in price instead of shopping around for the customer and not the ins company. Please take your car to Unicar Collision George is so professional he found all my parts brand new in the box. And saved me thousands my car out the door is $7200. If I had of taken it there 1st I would not be getting a rebuilt title. Unicar has been in business for over 100 years. And is all about the customer and bringing there car back to the beauty it once was. Ultimate will bilk your insurance for thousands. I will post photos once my car is back on the road.",Negative
Took my car in to get an estimate after struggling with the insurance company to get any answers . Kevin Pelland was super helpful and had me in and out in just about ten minutes. Thanks again.,Positive
Fast and friendly. Great and honest work. Ask for Kevin he was great at explaining everything and keeping in contact with us through the whole process.,Positive
"Very professional and experienced. Car was returned to me extra clean It looks awesome! The work done on my car looks terrific. I'm very pleased and will refer anyone who needs work done to call this guys. Special thanks to Kevin,if I ever need work done again I'm definitely coming back to Ultimate Collision!!! Thanks again",Positive
"Unfortunately I had had to use collision repair shops multiple times over the years. These guys are the best I have ever used. There is no other place in Las Vegas that I would recommend or ever go to before Ultimate Collision. This is not your typical grease garage full of posters of muscle cars and bikini models. They are high tech, clean, high end professionals. You can tell they invest in the best new equipment to do the best job on your car, not out of date tools and machines. I have been to two of their shops and they are identical. I understand they are now up to 4 shops around town and I am sure they duplicate their successful formula at all of them. If you care about your vehicle make sure you go here.",Positive
"Kevin is absolutely wonderful! He kept me updated on my repairs as they were happening, and finished with my car quickly and beautifully. My car looks great and is running great too! I will definitely return here for their great service! Thank you Kevin, you made this experience as painless as possible!",Positive
I was rear ended on the free and the other insurance company (USAA) gave me a list of places to choice from for the repairs. Ultimate collision was one of those place so I took my car to be inspected and it was a very pleasant experience! The receptionist was very nice and inviting. I waited only a few short moments for Kevin the inspector to help. The whole process took about 15 minutes and he gave me all the info I needed from letting me know I needed to contact USAA and let them know that the car was inspected and we just needed the rental car info. USAA called the next day with the info for the rental I called Kevin and he told me to bring the car in the following day and enterprise would pick me up from their office and take me to get the rental till mine was ready. They made the whole experience very pleasant considering the circumstances and did a great job on repairing my car! They even detailed it before giving it back to me. I will recommend this place to anyone who need repair work done! Thank you ultimate collision for the 5 star service I appreciate it!,Positive
"Someone backed into me, and I took my car to Ultimate Collision because they had the best reviews. My car was repaired, and the cost was lower than the estimate. That NEVER happens. It was fixed sooner than expected, plus, they cleaned the interior, as well as the exterior. WOW! What service. It looks brand new again, and is immaculate. This is a new experience for car repair, and I'm thrilled. This is a GREAT company with dedicated, really good employees. If needed, I will use them again, and I highly recommend this repair center.",Positive
"Can't say enough good things about Ultimate Collision Repair Center. Al preformed the estimate and took care of everything, making it so easy to work with them and my insurance. My car looked great when I picked it up, the work they did, including the matching paint on the bumper was amazing. Thank you Al and Ultimate, I will for sure be a repeat customer. Your professionalism was greatly appreciated, the work on my car was excellent.",Positive
"I have always had awesome experiences at Ultimate, friendly, on time delivery, and they communicate throughout the repair process to ensure satisfaction! I will always take my vehicles here and recommend it to any of my friends when they are in need of repairs. I highly recommend Ultimate Collision!! I always work with Kevin!!",Positive
I have had two vehicles repaired at this facility and was very satisfied with the results. Both vehicles are still running fine. They are an approved repair facility for USAA which added to my confidence in this repair center.,Positive
"Kevin is amazing and the staff at Ultimate are fully dedicated to ensuring you're back on the road in a timely manner and with confidence that your vehicle will be like new. I hit a bear traveling down from Michigan and not only did they get my vehicle fixed cosmetically in the time frame promised, they went above and beyond in having the engine and transmission issues I experienced addressed. Hopefully I won't have to see them again- but if you need to see someone, I wouldn't suggest anyone else!",Positive
"I hit a curb pretty aggressively with my 2015 Ford Focus ST and did some damage to the front bumper and the right wheel and took it to ultimate collision. The estimators and employees were very attentive and took my car in right away. I constantly got updates on the status of my car and they worked with my insurance company. The repairs look AMAZING! Car drives the exact same and looks incredible. I would 100% have ultimate complete any car services for me again. If you take your car there, ask for Lee or Jeremy. Great customer service.",Positive
Excellent service on insurance claim. Quick and professional. Amazing job. Provided a good car for us to use while repairs done. I would come back here even if it was on my dime. I can't imagine where 2 stars came from.,Positive
"So its been nearly four months that I took my Ford edge in for collision repair, they exceeded the two week repair I was quoted and was there three weeks. I didn't mind so much as they were friendly hence I did have to initiate every call for status reviews. My issues are that the manager expressed that if I wrote a positive review via yelp I would receive a $75 cash voucher. I called and was told they needed to view my comment and send the voucher as next step. I never received a voucher nor a follow up call. Negative reviews are not good business clearly. People want a reputable company with positive feedback, hence customer service should set apart on how customers are treated. Integrity says a lot and goes along way. They don't pride themselves on honorable business practices.",Negative
"This is a place where you take your vehicle, not caring about price, because the insurance company is paying. The prices are outrageous. 40% higher than the next lowest estimate I received and double what another shop quoted me for the same work. Both the receptionist and estimator (Lee) looked at me like I was a freak when I told them I'd be paying out of pocket. They looked concerned, and I could see the mental wheels spinning: ""OK, this is different; not sure what to do here."" But they resolved it: Just gouge him like we do insurance adjusters. The physical space is very nice. Someone designed it to be office-like and female-friendly. Very upscale. But when you look around, ask yourself, ""How is this all paid for?"" Answer: Insurance companies. No way this facility could survive if customers were paying the bills. Two stars just because it's clean and looks like a nice place for repairs if you aren't paying your own bill. But no more than two stars, because the prices are so ridiculous.",Negative
"If you are considering taking your vehicle for repairs to this facility STOP right now! Save yourself from having to experience disappointments and frustrations. If you still decide to take your vehicle to this place WARNING avoid by any means to deal with Al Gilbertson. I left my mini van for repair on April 18, 2016 and got it back May 10,2016. That was a period of 23 days and not one call did I received an update from Al. I had to call myself to follow up on the status of the repair. Only then Al would return the call but he NEVER initiated to give you any update. You leave your vehicle expecting to be informed but never heard anything back. This repair center needs to learn to anticipate their customers expectations, provide better customer service ONLY then do you earn 5 stars and recommendations.",Negative
"My rep was Kevin Pelland. I have a 2015 Subaru WRX STI, and pickiness is my middle name. There was extensive damage to my left rear quarter panel. This is a big job and Ultimate was the ultimate professionals. The work done was impeccable and Kevin was so gracious to accommodate my very picky eye. These guys are truly pros...a GREAT shop run by GREAT people. In this business, things can be shady. But you can rest easy with Ultimate Collision. I cannot recommend them highly enough. FIRST CLASS SHOP!",Positive
"Ultimate Auto Collision worked flawlessly with my insurance and completed an outstanding repair to get my truck looking great again! Ask for Kevin as he's quick, friendly and ensures that the everything is done top of the line. He also knows his way around a great bottle of wine if you need any advice! I highly recommend!",Positive
"You hope you don't ever need a body shop, but when you do, these are your guys. Ultimate gets all of my business (which, unfortunately, there is plenty of - Vegas drivers + my shiny car that seems to be a magnet for trouble). Ultimate works seamlessly with my insurance company and are always quick and communicative. My car leaves there looking brand new every time - you can't even tell any work was done, and that's the point!",Positive
"This was my first accident ever (46 yrs old), a minor side swipe incident. Never dealt with auto body repair shops ever. I had no idea which shop to pick, but this place was one of my insurance companies preferred shops and the insurance company that I work for highly recommended them. They are very nice, professional, the lobby is extremely clean, they explain things in great detail to you, and keep you informed during the week as to repair status. I dropped my car off on a Monday morning, they said that it would be ready the next Monday, (6 bus days) and then let me know on Thurs, that my car would be ready on Friday after 1400. I picked it up on Sat Morning, the car looked great, good as new, and it was done sooner than I thought it would be. Very impressed with this shop, and they made my first experience a good one. Thank you Ultimate Collision.",Positive
Painless and joyful was my experience with Ultimate Collision! They took care of all the insurance issues and had my car looking exceptional sooner than I expected and washed and vacuumed. What a treat! Friendly staff to boot. Thank you Ultimate Collision.,Positive
I had gone to this place for a few small repairs. Fairly priced but they were always late. The owner Richard did not follow through on the last job because he simply didn't know how to do it and when I asked why he started the job in the first place he became very disrespectful. You get what you paid for. Wouldn't recommend,Negative
This shop does is one of the best shops I've ever seen. I had a death in the family and had an 104 fever and was in pain.Jeremee went the extra mile to get my car repaired. Any one can be sure that you will be % 100 satisfied in bringing your car to Ultimate Collision.,Positive
"This place was the worst! If you go threw ins they do a crap job. Not only was there paint on my window & tape marks...but the entire left side of my vehicle is the wrong color! Then the say oh your car is not factory color & to paint the rest it's $3200! Ha...don't bother going to insurance either they backed their crappy job up & refused to have them fix it. Don't waste time, they are overpriced & do crap.",Negative
They did an awesome job did everything to take care of me after my daughter happened to hit the gas when going thru the garage no brake ran into our bathroom wall. Really worked with me since I was taking care of this myself. Everyone there is always awesome. I am referring one of my clients to them today. Jeremy outstanding job.,Positive
"My Tahoe paint was hacked up by a glass installer from Safelite. So, off to the body shop to make it look new again. These days, it's seems like a crap shoot as to whether or not you're going to get quality work or a hatchet job. I did my best to read up on these guys before stopping by for an estimate. The experience was pleasant & professional, so I rolled the dice. I picked my truck up today and perfect. Paint match appears flawless and they properly gapped the window so it matches the other side, like it was a factory job. Matt even found discontinued factory glass! Woohoo! The unit Safelite installed as lessor quality IMHO. The estimate was on the money and Matthew Veale, my rep was courteous, professional and returned all calls I made. Most importantly, he LISTENED to me on things like approving the color match before the new window was installed and again, making sure the glass gapping on the perimeter was like factory. So, I'm a happy customer and my SUV looks like it never happened. I will be back. Nice job guys! Finally, a quality vendor in Vegas, a town full of flakes!",Positive
"Oh man, this has been the most evil Summer ever for my car. At the end of May while in Los Angeles, some guy rear ended my bumper on the freeway. Crunched it. His fault, and his insurance took care of it. I took it to Ultimate, and in a few days, my bumper looked good as new. Last month, some fool decided that he didn't want to get on the 95 on-ramp here, threw his car in reverse, and crunched up the front of my car. Just smashed it to pieces. Again, his fault, and insurance (after dragging FOREVER with this guy), took care of it. This one was not a ""Quick and easy"". This one took 15 days to fix. But when I got it back, it looked like it rolled off the showroom floor. Two days later, I had a small issue with my car. Apparently, something hadn't been adjusted properly during the extensive repairs. They took the car in, tossed me in a rental, and then sent me on my way two days later. That said, it was starting to become comical how many times I had to stop by this car place during the course of my Summer. These guys are professionals. They do a great job, and they are thorough. And when I mentioned my remaining issue after the last repair, not one argument, stalling tactic, or ""drive it around a few days to see if it clears itself up"" nonsense I've heard from other repair places. They asked me to bring it in, and now it runs even better. Clearly, getting my car banged up has resulted in a better handling car in the long run. I'm very grateful to Ultimate for their solid, solid work. Nice people, efficient staff, and reliable quality work. They made a miserable Summer of unintentional demolition derby far more bearable to handle. All the same, I hope I'm not in their business any time soon. Nothing personal, but I just don't want to go through a third fender bender to have to see them again. I'll just send a Christmas card....",Positive
"Ultimate Auto Collision treated me with courtesy and respect, worked flawlessly with my insurance, and gave me some great referrals for work they didn't do, saving me money with my other car needs, too! I call them for all my car needs now. :)",Positive
"UPDATE - Six months after purchasing the car, it didn't run at all. It took me 3 months and a few thousand bucks to get it operational again. Stay away from Velocity! These 5 star reviews on Yelp are fakes. One of the guys posting actually works for Velocity! Just check the Better Business Bureau website and Rip Off Report and you'll see the truth about these crooks.",Negative
"DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS PLACE! Deceitful, dishonest, and horrible to work with. Not only did they sell my mother a vehicle that had major issues, but they then supposedly fixed the issues and charged my mother for them (and we took it to another mechanic who said they didn't really do the work they said they had done!!) My mother is the sweetest woman alive, and she works very hard for her money (as we all do), and this place sold her a vehicle that had issues after the first day. They said they would take care of the issues, but they did not hold true to their word. She bought a car back in February and they told her the car needed a wheel bearing and a few small engine repairs. They said they'd fix it in 3 days and to bring the car back then. The car had a two week warranty. She brought the car back in 3 days as told and waited in their office while they supposedly repaired the car. They came out after about an hour and said the wheel bearing had been fixed but that the car needed a new catalytic converter. The car blew a head gasket and she had the car towed back to them. They quoted her a price to fix it IN WRITING and then increased the rate a few hours later. She decided to have it towed to another place and they fixed the head gasket and also the water pump. This new mechanic told her the car needed a wheel bearing and we were shocked. They never fixed the wheel bearing even though they charged her for it! We then called Velocity and told them that the wheel bearing was NOT fixed like they had said. They rambled off that my mother should be grateful that she got a car so inexpensive and that they weren't going to fix it. So we spent another $300 to fix an issue that they had supposedly already fixed. We also found out the car needs front struts, and all engine mounts. These people are deceitful and have absolutely no integrity. Her $2500 ""great buy"" ended up being a $5500 piece of junk.",Negative
"I usually am very wary of small dealerships and automotive business owners. I've certainly met some slimy salesmen when looking for a decent used car. My experience with Velocity Auto Connection has restored my faith that there are still some business owners, mechanics, and salesmen out there with some decency and some integrity. Chris is excellent! I bought my car here after finding it on cars.com, he was cooperative regarding the price (we only had so much on us to spend at the time) and allowed us to pay the balance when we got our next paycheck. A few days later, it started having unforeseen problems that nobody could have predicted. Chris was so helpful, he paid to have it towed and then put a brand new transmission in it! During the repair process, he kept me well informed regarding what was going on, I was never confused or worried. He didn't try to swindle me or give me some excuse regarding why the repair wouldn't be covered. Now, thanks to him, I have a great, reliable little car to get me back and forth from Tucson and home (here in the valley) during the school year! Thanks, guys! I am eternally appreciative.",Positive
I highly recommend Velocity Auto Connection! Recently I needed some help after a tire issue I had. Super service and I could be happier.,Positive
"I happened across Velocity Auto Connection on Cars.com and was stunned by the great looking car online - I had to go check it out. I was looking for a car for my daughter and wanted something that would be reliable and in decent condition at a reasonable price. I've endured other dealerships that promoted cars as having gone through their 'certification inspection' only to drive all the way across the valley to find the car hasn't even been touched. Not so with Velocity! The car was indoors, in pristine condition! Chris was very easy to talk to and so open about all that he did to the car and how much he cares about not only the experience of buying a used car but how much he cares that the car itself is as good as it possibly can be. I am completely satisfied with my experience buying my daughters car from Chris! I truly believe I have found a dealership I can trust and when I need to purchase a car in the future, Velocity Auto Connection will be my first stop! Great Job Chris!! Keep it up! I'm going to talk up Velocity Auto Connection to everyone I come across that needs a quality used car!!",Positive
"My best friend referred me to Chris and they have serviced both my cars and did an excellent job- they are on time and fully complete with your service. They can do oil changes, new tires, detailing etc. I appreciate them and recommend them to all my friends.",Positive
"These guys are great! Super professional and nice, I got a good deal on my car and they didn't sell me any bull when I was buying! Definitely recommend them!",Positive
"Met Chris while a friend was buying a car from him. Friend was totally happy with his purchase and Chris is keeping an eye out for a vehicle for me as well! He spent time with me talking about realistic cars within my budget and what was important to me in a car. It doesn't feel like the run-a-round I have gotten at dealerships or buying blind off of CL. Thanks Chris, I appreciate your efforts and the time you are taking to find a car for me.",Positive
"I bought a new Piaggio MP3 500 from a dealer in Maine who didn't stock that model. It was a special order. After accepting delivery (3 months after order) I noticed a small oil leak which I had them check. They erroneously downplayed it to a loose oil filter. Since I spend most of my year in Arizona I elected to ship the scooter to my Arizona home. I looked up the local Piaggio dealer, brought in my scooter and they promptly diagnosed a miss machining of the crankcase to piston cylinder surface. After having my scooter apart and in their possession for about a month a Piaggio representative authorized a new engine which arrived in 2 weeks and was successfully installed. The length of time they had the scooter was not a real problem because it was during the coldest part of the year, through the holidays and during a vacation. I got a copy of the bill and it was about half the cost of the scooter. My cost was zero and I will receive a new but free to me, 600-mile service. Max, the service manager was excellent. Ron L.",Positive
I had the pleasure of revisiting this old favorite Bmw MC Dealer in the East Valley. Tylor the GM is fantastic and the rest of the staff was very accommodating with my questions and service needs. I was amazed with the inventory of hard to find GS & GSA Adventure models. The Indian showroom was beautifully laid out and tastefully done and the in store inventory of KLIM riding gear was 2nd to none in my travels. Very knowledgeable and polite with great inventory. ..Victory BMW/Indian deserves your consideration for future purchases. I hope your experience was as fantastic as mine.,Positive
Extremely disappointed. Rode out from Yuma to buy oil and crush washer for my oil change. I asked what they recommend as the oil to use and all pushed the BMW brand oil. $15 per quart. Going over receipts of prior oil change service performed by Victory BMW mechanics I discovered they used a much MUCH cheaper off the shelf oil. They could have recommended this oil in the first place! I'm loyal by nature and feel they do not reciprocate that loyalty. To top it off after riding 3 hours back to my house I discovered they gave me the wrong washer! I guess I'll have to ride to San Diego or Scottsdale for service and parts. After 3 years of motorcycle service and parts purchase at Victory BMW I now have no confidence in Victory BMW to keep my best interest as a loyal customer in mind. I wish them the best but they'll need to value repeat customers and not handle them as stooges.,Negative
"My visit lead me here forcably becuase they are the closest Royal Einfield dealer in Az to me. My purchase experinece was meh nothing to that a new sales person can fumble through,but i love the bike.i bought this bike back Aug2014, 3 months later i was called by the sales manager that they needed the vin number on my bike. I was emidiately concerned because i had purchased an extended warranty and if something went wrong with my bike the matching numbers were not correct, they wouldnt cover me. I also took a loan out on a bike thats not matching my bank loan. I called and talked to the manager Matt, and he casually asks for me to look at the vin and to call him back asap. I also took the time to explain to him that i had ordered bar end mirrors and they had not only sent the wrong ones but only sent me one mirror. He said "" send me the right vin and ill send the correct mirrors to you"". Today is 3/2/15 i still havnt recieved my correction on my bank loan nor have i seen my mirrors. This is to bad that this is how they treat thier customers. I will take my bike to get serviced somewhere else, this is so out of integrity and Id be dumb to think that they are honest enough to address mechanical issues. PLEASE DO NOT BUY HERE, LOTS OF HEADACHES AND WASTE OF TIME.",Negative
"Everybody is very nice and friendly, especially Max - but don't expect to find BMW experts at the service department: I own a 2003 R1200C and noticed a clunking noise from the engine. I did a Google search and found some reports which talked about problems with the original chain tensioner and I mentioned this to the mechanics (there were 3 mechanics standing around, a supervisor examined the engine with his stethoscope). The answer was ""No, it can't be the chain tensioner, the mileage is too low and if it was broken it would sound different, don't worry about it, other bikes sound a lot worse than yours."" At home I did some more online research and found that the original spring loaded chain tensioner was redesigned and replaced with a hydraulic one. the original spring loaded chain tensioner is not even available anymore as a spare part. It is very easy to find out which chain tensioner is installed because one has a 10mm head, the other one a 12mm head. i saw that my bike still had the old type installed and ordered the improved chain tensioner which was around $ 35,- Installation took about 45 minutes and I am not a mechanic (!) After the installation the noise had disappeared and the bike was also running better, probably due to a more accurate timing. The article on the internet also talked about the danger of not fixing this problem: the slack of the timing chain leads to premature wear on the plastic rail of the chain tensioner which might fall apart. The pieces then fall into the engine which has to be pulled. The engine cases have to be separated to remove the broken chain tensioner rail. It is sad that you go to a BMW dealership expecting to get service from BMW experts and at the end you get better advice from Google. I am pretty sure that there is a BMW service bulletin about this problem. I am under the impression that Victory BMWs technicians are not even BMW factory trained and if they are, BMWs training sucks.",Negative
"I arrived on a Monday (yesterday) evening at 5:45 PM to drop off my bike for routine maintenance. It should have been plenty of time to check the bike in. Ummm. No. Posted hours are ""close at 6 PM."" The employees were pulling out of the parking lot at 5:45 PM. I had driven 40+ minutes from North Phoenix through rush hour. Guys...you're a major business, not a mom and pop bicycle shop. You don't close early because you feel like it. I should have been clued in a few weeks ago when I wanted to drop the same bike off on a Sunday (the website says ""Sunday drop-off only."" Ummm. Not true. I luckily called to verify and the guy answering the phone said service is closed on Sunday. He didn't know anything about the website and didn't care. So...fix your website to reflect the correct hours. And...posted hours are not a suggestion, THEY'RE YOUR WORKING HOURS. I won't make that drive again. Make sure you call.

"Seemingly nice guys but don't expect much. This is basic and no frills: bikes being sold with scratches, flaws, and without owners manuals nor service history. The price is definitely the attraction (if they don't shaft you with service and handling fees). These are guys with a Bud Lite and Beer Nuts mentality, lording over champagne and caviar products. It will be a wonder if they are still around in 3 years.",Positive
"I got new tires here for my BMW in the middle of a 9K ride. The prices were fair, and I liked the ""free"" install. Max in service is a true professional - friendly, knowledgeable, and provided excellent service. He rattled off information on my bike model from memory and explained some more technical concepts in terms I (as a newer rider) could understand. Other employees there were friendly as well, and it was nice to have free wifi as I waited. I would definitely come back here!",Positive
"I ordered parts over the phone to have shipped to me, but then decided to have them do the installation as well on my 800GS. The parts and service counter were excellent in their service and attention to detail in ordering my parts and getting me into a service appointment. The service department had a bit of a struggle getting the old parts off, but I was kept informed, step by step during the process and given options on how to proceed. The service technician kept at it and was able to remove the stubborn part and proceed with the normal installation. Even though the service took about twice as long then quoted, the price did not go up. I was extremely thankful for that. Overall I was extremely impressed with the parts and service department and their communication skills and customer service.",Positive
"Another satisfying service visit. Had some new TKC80's installed. Was quick to get in and quick to get out. Can't beat the donuts and coffee on Saturday morning visits. They installed the tires just perfectly and a couple of the service guys gave me some good pointers on testing various inflation levels to suit my size, load and planned riding style. Thanks Victory! I'll be back.",Positive
"I've purchased two bikes at Victory. (BMW motorcycle and a Piaggio scooter) Both from Tom the big guy that looks like a grizzly bear. Tom is always patient, knows his bikes and fits you with the right bike. My wife adores him. My bikes are always serviced there. The Victory folks are always honest and up front about the cost and discuss your options. I've had bad service a couple times over the years, but in each case the person that took care of me was not employed very long. Great bike shop!",Positive
"Great group of people, especially Bill!! The crew at this dealership are very much no-pressure salespeople (which I truly appreciate). My fiancé and I went in to look at a Vespa for me to ride, and Bill was very attentive to my questions, and willing to give advice and help teach me how to use the kick stand... did I mention that Bill spoke to ME the whole time we were there? (unlike other dealerships, who mostly spoke to my fiancé, despite his insistence that the vehicle is for me, so it was all up to my decisions) In a nutshell, we experienced a very laid-back, positive buying experience where the quality of the vehicles they sell speak more than anything the sales staff could say.",Positive
"I bought a new BMW f650gs twin two weeks ago (May 2012). It was missing it's owner's manual so the sales person said he would order it ""overnight"". I came in two days later to pick it up from the parts department and after 10 minutes of waiting, could not get the parts guy to help me. Later that day I received a phone call that the manual hadn't even come in and that it would be in on Thursday. I show up Friday and there are 3 guys at the parts and service counter. I asked one of them if I could pick up my owners manual, and he said only the parts guy could help me. The parts guy knew I was waiting but insisted on talking about his days riding Ducati motorcycles on flattracks to somebody ... on and on and on. Finally I walked out, not happy. I called my sales guy and asked him to send me the manual. IIt finally arrived after two weeks ... maybe I took ""invisibility"" pills or something, because I had the exact same experience a year ago when I came in to check on some parts prices for my friend in Texas (no dealer at the time in his city). Update as of August, 2012. After sending letters to the VP at BMW NA, I was finally about to resolve an outstanding issue - my BMW ""Ride Smart"" reward. It took almost 2.5 months of nagging BMW corporate to rectify a few simple issues with my very expensive motorcycle purchase. I have read so many great things about this dealer on the internet (e.g. BMW forums) but did not receive even a basic level of customer service and attention to two issues: a missing manual (finally got it) and a missing reward for purchasing a new BMW (finally got it). Because of this treatment, I will never buy another BMW product. August 2012 update: I made a video showing the good, bad and ugly of this motorcycle. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6koHzbDCCNk&list=UUSZgIbvZItJr78kHY3Y9wnA&index=5&feature=plcp Update 01/2013. I have had multiple issues with my brand new BMW and finally have given up on Victory for any form of proper resolution. BMW NA doesn't care. I am so frustrated with this bike, I continue to make the payments, but have permanently parked it at my house in Jerome until I can have the time to work on it myself and correct all of the defects (hard starting, mid range sputter, tires losing pressure, heated grips not working). BMW is the worst product I have ever purchased. I did just buy a new Suzuki Bandit - now that's a quality product with no defects! Every time I drive by Victory I have bad memories of paying more than full retail and getting no service or followup - I feel they cheated me and I can only hope Karma will ultimately knock on their door. Update 06/2013 - I have been using Go AZ for BMW issues I cannot resolve - they are an awesome dealer. I will never step foot in the Victory dealership again.",Negative
"We originally bought our BMW SR1000rr here and thought there were a stand up bunch of guys, but after a terrible experience with our recent 6,000 mile check up all I can say is GO TO SCOTTSDALE. Victory BMW's service department either honestly doesn't have the competence to know what they are doing or are actively trying to rip you off. Our bike went into their shop working beautifully and came out not starting and stalling to point it was un-rideable. Problems dragged on for 2 months before the bike is finally working again. Things happen. We just wanted them to own to the fact that the mechanic made a mistake and fix the bike. Instead they repeatedly tried to charge us for parts and service that were covered under warranty, showed a complete lack of initiative to resolve a problem that they caused, and ignored the symptoms only to waste time fixing parts that weren't broken. Sorry to say we would strongly recommend you avoid Victory BMW's service department and watch any bills closely for false charges.",Negative
"I've never bought a bike here, but I have bought a lot of accessories, riding gear, and had service done. It's always been a great experience. They are helpful when you are trying to decide on riding gear and get fitted. Service is super-friendly and makes it clear they appreciate your business. Prices are middle of the road, not cheap internet prices but not jacked up either.",Positive
"Total bait and switch sales department! Will tell you one price over the phone, then quote you another when you arrive! Happened to me personally 3 times. I bought from Scottsdale BMW. One quote, one price, done deal. Buyer beware...",Negative
"Absolutely amazing work! Flawless lines on my 9ft wall using 3 vinyls strips... can't even tell unless you look really close. Edges and seams were well laid and the quality of the image itself was beautiful. A hand drawn sketch was given to them and they made it into graphic, brought it to life, gave it a background. I mean... the skill these guys have, I'm floored and beyond happy. Far exceeded my expectations! As well, super reasonable too! Guaranteed great work, on time, and they will bring a vision to life! So happy!!!",Positive
"We have had Warrior Wraps do multiple jobs for us. The first one, they didn't do well right out of the gate, but after two returns, they were able to get it right. In all, our business has had seven vehicle wraps done by three different companies. Were we still in SLC, we would have had these last three done right, but we opted for Warrior Wraps as for the first job, we really liked Carlos (no longer there) and for the second/third jobs, we really felt Izzy would get the job done right. We also very much like their designer; he's a pro and wants everything to be perfect. The second wrap was a very difficult motorcycle trailer that they had to re-do three times, but was still never satisfactory. See photos to understand why. The wrap began lifting the next day, and Warrior Wraps tried to fix it, but was unable to fix it. The attached photos are 30-days post wrap. They told us ""we'll take care of you on the next one"" because Izzy and Chris are just ""those kinda guys."" Nonetheless, we believed Izzy when he told us he'd do it ""right"" on this very simple cargo trailer. Having had wraps done before, we knew to remove every single piece of hardware we could remove. There was absolutely _NOTHING_ on this trailer to impede the wrap. We explained that we wanted it wrapped vertically so that there were no seams. We even removed fenders so they could seamlessly go top to bottom. Except...they didn't. When they called to tell us it was done, we found it was horizontally wrapped, and with very crooked seams to boot. We were given a Bravo Sierra story that this is ""standard in the industry, to wrap this way."" Having had this done before, we knew this wasn't accurate, and so did a little bit of research. Virtually everyone we spoke to told us what we already knew; vertical seams are not standard and usually only done if the vehicle contours require it, or customers request it. Further, the seam was seam-up, creating a dirt line (a shelf that catches dirt because it will catch water). https://bit.ly/2KbHaRU This will not only be unsightly, but also shorten the life of the wrap. Even though we are experienced only in purchasing wraps, we _now_ know a LOT about the best-practices, because we talked to manufacturers, installers, and visited many websites and watched a lot of video. Warrior Wraps has their own story, different than industry Best-Practices. Additionally, they inexplicably broke our tongue crank. They didn't pay to replace that, either, nor offer a discount. They couldn't locate the broken parts. The crank was new, purchased 4 days before WW received the trailer. There went another $50.00 Next, the story changed to ""it's more expensive to wrap vertically"" so we agreed to pay an additional amount to have it re-wrapped vertically. When the call came that the re-wrap was done, we were yet more disappointed. Instead of untying ropes placed so that the doors didn't fly open during travel (as Izzy had agreed), the installers wrapped around the ropes, creating unsightly seams. Remember, we'd gone to a LOT of effort to ensure there were no hardware issues for the wrappers. The entire trailer was straight lines, no impediments. They merely needed to untie one bow-tie knot (like undoing shoelaces). There were several areas of patched together pieces, areas that weren't covered, scores in the vinyl, and vinyl that didn't attach properly. We had to take the trailer to another place to try to finish the work, but they didn't want to touch it due to ""the trailer not being prepared by the wrapping company properly."" We were screwed. They also showed us the difference in the quality of wrap materials used, and we realized we have a very short-life wrap, one that won't last more than a year or so due to how thin it is and how it absorbs inks. We complained to Warrior Wraps and were told they'd make it right. We called several times and received no call-backs. They refused to schedule a repair and told us we're more difficult than they like their customers to be. Check out the pix; would YOU accept this kind of work? WW offer great bait n' switch pricing. Beware; you get what you pay for. [edit] We submitted a complaint to American Express (through whom we paid for the trailer) and American Express couldn't get a response from WW either. After two months, American Express closed the case. Today, Warrior Wraps called saying they were coming to take the trailer because ""we didn't pay the full amount."" We have now turned the matter over to an attorney. We recommend folks avoid this business; they're not quality craftspeople. They don't stand behind their work, and they make threats when called out on the quality of their work. Call Incognito. They wouldn't fix much, but they were a great help when we contacted them, and offered up some solutions that while not awesome, workable. http://www.incognitowraps.com/",Negative
"I got a chrome delete done to my Jeep Grand Cherokee. The quality of work was good. However the quality of customer service by ""Sheets"" was complete garbage. Guy yelled and cursed me out when I asked him for a revised quote because his team couldn't remove the door handles off of my vehicle to delete the chrome. He instead tried to sale me on tinting my taillights. He got upset because I told him I thought the taillights tint for $150 was too expensive and rather have the door handles removed from my original $700 quote. He told me to ""come pick up my s***"". ""Sheets"" is a complete nightmare to work with and I would never recommend anyone to visit Warrior Wraps. Front office staff was good. But dealing with ""Sheets"" who makes the final decision on what to charge customers is unacceptable to work with.",Negative
"Had my van wrapped here, great job. Graphics were done in one day. Was asked to give them 3 days to complete the job, got a call that the van was ready a day early. Very happy with the results.",Positive
Could not be happier with the service and product. They were very prompt when scheduling service. The staff on the phones when I called were super helpful and answered all my questions. When the guys came out to measure the walls and vehicle they were very professional. Very quickly they had proofs for me to approve. We made changes and within no time they were back at out business to install. They sent two installers to make the job fast and they did an amazing job. I had two huge walls covered inside our business and two large banners installed on our vehicle. Highly recommended!,Positive
Sheets was awesome and getting my logo made for wrapping a shuttle. Came in to get installed and guys were great. Highly recommend for any wrapping needs.,Positive
I had my Jeep custom wrapped by this place and it was nothing but a waste of money. Until this day I keep finding that there are still missing screws. Not to mention the worst customer service by their so called manager.,Negative
I was driving to work this morning and their work truck cut everyone off last minute. This was on the 15 before Tropicana. Good looking truck. Asshole driver. Would never give a person like this business.,Negative
Amazing!! They did such a great job. The process was very quick and Alicia made sure things were moving along. They listened to what I was looking for and made it a reality. I'm very happy with the wrap. Thank you everyone!,Positive
"Use Warrior Wraps repeatedly and they always do a great job with our equipment! Extremely proficient,Timely and detailed! I would highly recommend Warrior Wraps and when you call ask for Corey to come out and take care of you! He always gets the job done right the first time and is very knowledgable about his work. Professional and detail oriented, with him on the job our wraps turn out great! Wouldn't go anywhere else! Nice work Corey very much appreciated!",Positive
I had my VW CC wrapped Dec 15. It has been a great experience having this new look! I get people stopping me all the time to ask about my car and where I got it done. I would recommend Warrior Wraps 100%!!! You will love the new look too.,Positive
Absolutely love Sarah her customer service is superb!!! she goes above and beyond from beginning to end to make sure you're satisfied. been going to warrior wraps for a long time and she's always been great. I can't leave out Percy his designs are amazing!!! you have to check him out.,Positive
"Awful with customer service. I called on the telephone to inquire about a couple of jobs. They took all the information they needed and said someone (a female) would get back to me. Never received a call. I went in person the following day. Someone took measurements but said the office manager would be in touch with me. Again, she never did. My girlfriend, who wants to have her entire 4Runner wrapped, had similar experience and feels the same way. She had warned me that they never got back to her but thought I would have a better experience. Seems they don't need or want anymore business.",Negative
These guys exceeded my expectations. From the time I got my quote to the time I picked up was only about a week. I brought my 2017 Camaro SS here to get it murdered out with a matte black. Sarah and her team went right to work and took care of everything from the side mirrors to the door handles. It looks amazing. I'm very happy with the work they did.,Positive
I love the service level provided. Great customer service. Exceptional attention to detail. Quality work are put into everything they do,Positive
"One star review... Called this place because I saw it driving. I was debating on getting my Ferrari wrapped here instead of having it wrapped in Cali and then transporting it here... I called and asked the girl that answers the phone: ""do you do color changes?"" Her answer: what is that? I said well I don't want advertising I just want the car to be white instead of black. She said yes we do that. Good I say, can you give me a price quote for a Ferrari 458, I know price matters depending on color and wrap choice? She then says I can't quote anything until I look at the car. I then explained that I'm buying the car in Cali and have gotten quotes from many reputable shops there, Impressive Wrap and also PFS in Orange County. She then rudely goes : "" bring the car"". Um ok whatever... Impressive Wrap which is a huge franchise and PFS when I called them both were very helpful informative and let me know at least a price range and told me what colors and shades could cost. I tried to keep my high end wrap business here locally but apparently they can't answer simple questions... definitely will NOT be taking my Ferrari here LOL",Negative
Warrior Wraps wrapped my BMW 135i in white satin with red accents. Car came out perfect. All of the team members were extremely professional and friendly and I got a great price! Definitely recommend them!,Positive
"I recently got my truck wrapped at Warrior Wraps, the process from start to finish was smooth. The staff is friendly and the shop has a great feeling to it. I highly recommend Warrior Wraps.",Positive
Just want to say thanks to Sarah and all of the people who work there. The professionalism they have is amazing. Customer service and communication are the best I have ever had. Their work is awesome. I will for sure be a return customer and recommend Warrior Wraps to anyone considering any of the services they provide!!!,Positive
We've been using Warrior Wraps for a few years now. A++ service. Sarah is amazing and always quick to respond. Would recommend them for any of your wrap needs!,Positive
Warrior Wraps did an awesome job on my truck. They did a wrap on the roof and front end. Came out perfect and has held up really good. Would definitely recommend for anyone to use.,Positive
"These guys are super cool, and will help you with whatever you can imagine for a design on your car. Even if you know cars or just started they will take car of you! Highly recommended. Sarah is awesome and always nice by the way. Great service.",Positive
"I was initially a little annoyed that I couldn't get in for an appointment after a couple attempts, but I figured, if they're that busy, they must be doing something right. Finally Sarah got me an appointment Monday morning. It just so happens that I'm opening a new nightclub and Memorial Day Weekend had me working double shifts for the last two weeks, but I wanted to get my car done. I showed up at 9 (after about 3 1/2 hours sleep) to find that the doors were locked. My thought was that she forgot it was Memorial Day when she made my appt. and I went down there for nothing. I left a pretty rude message for her wasting my time and went on to work my 9th and 10th shifts for the week. I assumed that, in typical Las Vegas businesses form, that would be the end of it. Much to my surprise, she called back and offered an apology, a reasonable excuse and to name my time to come in and make it right. (Apparently there was a guy in the back but hadn't unlocked the front door yet). Sarah got me in right away and the final product is great!",Positive
I've been coming here for the past 6 months for work and Sarah is always so helpful!! It makes my day when I get to see her smiling face!!,Positive
"Wonderful service, and Sarah at the front desk was extremely helpful. They wrap your car in record time, and offer you free snacks and Netflix while you wait! I highly recommend this place!",Positive
Sarah helped me out the same day! I needed a banner printed and another company was going to charge me double the price with a longer wait time. I am so pleased I will definitely use Warrior Wraps again!,Positive
"This place is terrible. Please save your money and go else where. First my friend wanted to wrap his car and had to put a deposit down, normal. After deciding be no longer wanted to do it, he asked for his deposit and they told him they would give him store credit not money. This is their policy. Second I bought credit from my friend and has them wrap the roof on my brand new car (from the dealership) When I got my car back the car was dented and the wrap looked bad. They did not take responsibility for the damage but they did say they would re do the wrap. After getting the dents out I retuned (foolish me) they wrapped my roof again but the unprofessional workers they have did not wash off the tree sap that was sitting on top of the car (basic instruction clean surface before applying) . The wrap was wayyyy worse than before. I was so frustrated with this company I took the wrap off myself and took the loss on my money. If I were to go back I know for a fact they wouldn't take responsibility like the fist time. This place is over priced. I only went there because my friend couldn't get his money back. Same wrap anywhere else would have been 150$ with them 250$ don't do it!!!",Negative
Great company to work with! From the creative process with Percy's genius ideas through to the installation. Mike the owner is a great guy and runs a top notch business. Its always a pleasure to work with Sarah because she always makes the extra effort to get us taken care of quickly. If you want the best wrap in town these guys got it down!,Positive
"I have done $thousands$ in business here and they always take care of me! Mike, Sara and Percy are awesome! They don't use cheap material like other shops. I will be back again soon for more work.",Positive
I'm so grateful this company was recommended to me. I experienced amazing and helpful customer service as well as quick design and installation. If possible I would rate them 6 stars. Ask for Sarah and Percy for your graphic design needs.,Positive
"I called the 800 number on the website and have not dealt with anyone in person. The information on the website is deceiving. They don't buy just ANY car. I have a 1994 Mercury Cougar with only 71,000 original miles. It's in perfect running condition and considered a classic by muscle car enthusiasts. I was told b by a person on the phone they're not interested because of the year. Then I tried on-line chat. Vanessa told me it's good for scrap and they'll take it off my hands for $100 and pick it up for free. Really??? Kelly Blue Book has it valued at $1800 for a private sale.",Negative
"Roman Alvarado was awesome! He walked me through the whole selling process & got me the best price for my car. I'm glad I called We Buy Cars for help selling my car. I'd highly recommend them to anyone for fast, professional, service & same day payment!",Positive
Roman Alvarado was extremely professional...he did everything he could to get us top dollar for our car. Would recommend him to anyone looking to sell their car! Thanks again!,Positive
"Roman Alvarado was very polite, courteous and a straight shooter. I felt comfortable with him and the process. I really feel that he went to bat for me and his company, balancing the negotiation process to make both parties happy. I feel relieved to have that process done in less then 30 minutes!",Positive
"I had fortunately bought a new car and needed to sell my old one. I called WeBuyCars.com and easily setup an appointment for an inspector to come check out my car. I met with Roman Alvarado who was very kind, humble, and helpful person. Mr Alvarado made the process as easy and painless as possible. If you ever have the opportunity to use this service, I definitely recommend it.",Positive
"I was looking to sell a 2004 Lexus with about 110,000 miles on it. I called WeBuyCars and gave them my information and they gave me a really good quote. Then they told me that they would have somebody come and look at the vehicle the same day. They sent out Roman later that evening who was very courteous, respectful, and polite. After inspecting the vehicle he made me an offer a little lower than quote over the phone. After a short conversation Roman made me a second offer that was right in between the first 2 offers and I agreed that the offer was more than fair. There was a lien on the car that I was selling so I had to get all of that squared away with the paperwork. So after a couple of weeks Roman came back and did another inspection and we sealed the deal. Roman struck me as trustworthy. Someone who you could do business with only using a handshake, the old fashioned way. I will definitely use them again if I ever need to sell another car, and I will refer them to family and friends.",Positive
The process was a smooth transaction. The gentleman Roman that they had sent over to look at our non-running car was professional and courteous. I think the only issue was that the gal online gave us a much higher quote than what they offered at time of purchase.,Positive
